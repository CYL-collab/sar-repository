This expansion is particularly evident with the widespread adoption of large language models. Currently, the infrastructure supporting ML systems, such as cloud services and computing hardware, which are increasingly becoming foundational to the ML system environment, is increasingly adopted to support continuous training and inference services. Nevertheless, it has been shown that the increased data volume, complexity of computations, and extended run times challenge the stability of ML systems, efficiency, and availability, precipitating system aging. To address this issue, we develop a novel solution, KPAMA, leveraging Kubernetes, the leading container orchestration platform, to enhance the autoscaling of computing workflows and resources, effectively mitigating system aging. KPAMA employs a hybrid model to predict key aging metrics and uses decision and anti-oscillation algorithms to achieve system resource autoscaling. Our experiments indicate that KPAMA markedly mitigates system aging and enhances task reliability compared to the standard Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and systems without scaling capabilities.",JSS,measurement-based; other mitigation,深度学习系统; 虚拟化系统

The catastrophic consequences caused by these accidents make people realize the importance of software trustworthiness. As an indispensable means to ensure software quality, traditional trustworthiness measurement evaluates the software trustworthiness by studying the trustworthy attributes in a static way. However, most of the factors considered in trustworthy attributes tend to be dynamic with time. The current research often ignores the changes in software after running for some time, and cannot reflect the changes in software trustworthiness at different running times. Objective: Our objective in this paper is to study the relationship between running time and software trustworthiness, and design a running time-related software trustworthiness measurement model from the untrustworthy evidence related to software aging. Method: We first extract the untrustworthy evidence from the bugs related to software aging in 5 subsystems of 4 public defect databases and 18 well-known software accidents, establish a risk level model, and design metric elements of untrustworthy evidence based on software aging. Then we construct a software aging cause category trustworthiness measurement model based on Boltzmann entropy. Finally, we build a software trustworthiness measurement model based on weighted Boltzmann entropy. For the weight values used in the model, the Brassard Priority Synthesis Analysis method was used to determine them. Result: Different from the common resource consumption parameter and performance parameter, a model based on weighted Boltzmann entropy can describe the influence of various parameters on the software’s trustworthiness through risk state. It can reflect the change of system state and describe the system state completely. Conclusion: The empirical study shows the effectiveness and practicality of our method for evaluating software dynamic trustworthiness. Meanwhile, it also indicates a promising avenue for future research and application in the field of software trustworthiness measurement.",IST,UDN,非特定的

A long and continuous running of operating system (OS) hosting container-based services can encounter software aging that leads to performance deterioration and even causes system failures. OS rejuvenation techniques can mitigate the impact of software aging but the rejuvenation trigger interval needs to be carefully determined to reduce the downtime cost due to rejuvenation. This paper proposes a comprehensive semi-Markov-based approach to quantitatively evaluate the effect of OS rejuvenation on the dependability and the performance of a container-based service. In contrast to the existing studies, we neither restrict the distributions of time intervals of events to be exponential nor assume that backup resources are always available.

However, DL-based ARB prediction models face a dual challenge: overcoming overfitting to enhance generalization and managing the high labeling costs associated with extensive data requirements. To address the first issue, we utilize the sparse and binary nature of spiking communication in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which inherently provides brain-inspired regularization to effectively alleviate overfitting. Therefore, we propose a Spiking Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN)-based ARB prediction model along with a training framework that handles the model’s spatial-temporal dynamics and non-differentiable nature. To reduce labeling costs, we introduce a Bio-inspired and Diversity-aware Active Learning framework (BiDAL), which prioritizes highly informative and diverse samples, enabling more efficient usage of the limited labeling budget. This framework incorporates bio-inspired uncertainty to enhance informativeness measurement along with using a diversity-aware selection strategy based on clustering to prevent redundant labeling. Experiments on three ARB datasets show that ARB-SCNN effectively reduces overfitting, improving generalization performance by 6.65% over other DL-based classifiers. Additionally, BiDAL boosts label efficiency for ARB-SCNN training, outperforming four state-of-the-art active learning methods by 4.77% within limited labeling budgets.",TETC,PRE,Linux、MySQL、AXIS、HTTPD

Menasché; André B. Bondi,IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing,299-313,2,13,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE),,,2025-4,"In this article, we report on the application of resiliency enforcement strategies that were applied to a microservices system running on a real-world deployment of a large cluster of heterogeneous Virtual Machines (VMs). We present the evaluation results obtained from measurement and modeling implementations. The measurement infrastructure was composed of 15 large and 15 extra-large VMs. The modeling approach used Markov Decision Processes (MDP). On the measurement testbed, we implemented three different levels of software rejuvenation granularity to achieve software resiliency. We have discovered two threats to resiliency in this environment. The first threat to resiliency was a memory leak that was part of the underlying open-source infrastructure in each VM. The second threat to resiliency was the result of the contention for resources in the physical host, which is dependent on the number and size of VMs deployed to the physical host. In the MDP modeling approach, we evaluated four strategies for assigning tasks to VMs with different configurations and different levels of parallelism. Using the large cluster under study, we compared our approach of using software aging and rejuvenation with the state-of-the-art approach of using a network of VMs deployed to a private cloud without software aging detection and rejuvenation. In summary, we show that in a private cloud with non-elastic resource allocation in the physical hosts, careful performance engineering needs to be performed to optimize the trade-offs between the number of VMs allocated and the total memory allocated to each VM.",TETC,model-based,虚拟化系统

To address potential software aging-related issues, rejuvenation is often employed to clean up their state and maximize performance and availability. In this work, we propose a framework to model the performability of service chains with rejuvenation. Performance modeling uses queueing theory, specifically adopting an $M/G/m$M/G/m model with the Allen-Cunneen approximation, to capture real-world aspects related to service times. Availability modeling is addressed through the Multidimensional Universal Generating Function (MUGF), a recent technique that achieves computational efficiency when dealing with systems with many sub-elements, particularly useful for multi-provider service chains. Additionally, we deploy an experimental testbed based on the Open5GS service chain, to estimate key performance and availability parameters. Supported by experimental results, we evaluate the impact of rejuvenation on the performability of the Open5GS service chain. The numerical analysis shows that i) the configuration of replicas across nodes is important to meet availability goals; ii) rejuvenation can bring one additional “nine” of availability, depending on the time to recovery; and iii) MUGF can significantly reduce computational complexity through straightforward algebraic manipulations.",TETC,model-based,MEC-SFC

Various stochastic models of Software Aging and Rejuvenation (SAR) have been developed, mostly having an underlying stochastic process in the class of Continuous Time Markov Chains (CTMCs), Semi-Markov Processes (SMPs), and Markov Regenerative Processes (MRGPs) under the enabling restriction, requiring that at most one general (GEN), i.e., non-Exponential, timer be enabled in each state. We present a SAR model with an underlying MRGP under the bounded regeneration restriction, allowing for multiple GEN timers to be concurrently enabled in each state. This expressivity gain not only supports more accurate fitting of duration distributions from observed statistics, but also enables the definition of mixed rejuvenation strategies combining time-based and inspection-based policies, where the time to the next inspection or rejuvenation depends on the outcomes of diagnostic tests. Experimental results show that replacing GEN timers with Exponential timers with the same mean (to satisfy the enabling restriction) yields inaccurate rejuvenation policies, and that mixed rejuvenation outperforms time-based rejuvenation in maximizing reliability, though at the cost of an acceptable decrease in availability.",TETC,hybrid,非特定的

However, despite the benefits conferred by Cloud-Edge collaborative systems, challenges arise from prolonged operation, rapid evolution, and resource constraints. These challenges may accelerate software aging, resulting in performance degradation, functional disruptions, and increased susceptibility to errors. Software rejuvenation acts as a preemptive and proactive maintenance strategy designed to alleviate the consequences of software aging. Although task migration is a commonly used method for software rejuvenation, addressing software aging in complex Cloud-Edge collaborative systems requires dynamic task migration to adapt to environmental changes. Therefore, to develop a task migration-based rejuvenation strategy with lower latency, energy consumption, and software rejuvenation cost, this paper introduces a method for generating software rejuvenation strategies based on Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Cloud-Edge collaboration systems, named GRCEM. Initially, the environment is modeled to define the state space, action space, and training rewards, meticulously designed to minimize rejuvenation costs for the Cloud-Edge collaborative system. Subsequently, a distributed execution algorithm for deep reinforcement learning is devised, treating each node as an autonomous agent responsible for acquiring knowledge and enhancing rejuvenation strategies through continuous interaction with the system environment. Finally, the rejuvenation strategy is formulated, characterized by its optimal rejuvenation cost. The experimental results demonstrate that the GRCEM method accomplishes software rejuvenation with reduced rejuvenation costs compared to the baseline method. Furthermore, the system’s performance transitions from the aging state to the robust state after rejuvenation, thereby significantly enhancing the availability and reliability of the Cloud-Edge collaboration system.",COMPSAC,measurement-based,云、边缘计算环境

This is primarily attributed to the accumulation of runtime errors, commonly referred to as aging-related bugs (ARBs). ARBP aims to detect and address ARBs before software release, optimizing testing resource allocation. However, ARBP’s effectiveness relies heavily on dataset quality. Prior research often relied on manually designed metrics that lack semantic features, resulting in low prediction accuracy. Some studies construct models to learn semantic features from source code, but typically focus on token-level features from abstract Syntax Trees, neglecting critical topological and functional connections. In this paper, we introduce the SGT model, an ARBP method based on Graph-Transformer. This model efficiently extracts semantic information and logical structures from source code, capturing data dependencies and program dependencies. We also propose sub-graph sampling based on node degree to reduce structural complexity and apply random oversampling to address class imbalance. Experiments on three projects demonstrate notable improvements. For instance, SGT achieved F1 scores of 0.726 and 0.706 on Linux and MySQL, respectively.

However, software aging characterization is relatively complicated, and only fitting the variations for a single aging indicator cannot grasp the comprehensive degradation process across different case systems; moreover, since software systems often exhibit long and short-term inherent degradation characteristics, existing prediction models possess a poor ability for modeling both global and local information simultaneously. To tackle the above problems, a novel TTAF prediction framework based on the parallel multi-scale temporal convolution network and transformer (named PMTT) is proposed, by mapping various system running indicators reflecting the software aging to TTAF. PMTT possesses the following distinctive characteristics. First, a local feature extraction module that contains multiple channel TCNs with different scales is developed to extract inherent local information from the raw input. Second, in a parallel manner, a global feature extraction module integrating transformer blocks is built to extract global information representation synchronously using the self-attention mechanism. Afterward, high-level global–local features extracted from different channels are fused, and TTAF is estimated through two fully connected regression layers using the fused features. The proposed PMTT has been compared to seven competitors using run-to-failure data collected from Android and OpenStack systems. The experiments have demonstrated the superiority of PMTT, showing an average improvement of 11.2%, 9.0%, and 9.3% in performance across three evaluation metrics compared with the optimal baseline model.",JSS,measurement-based,Android

However, the aging time series data in cloud servers often exhibits non-linearity and stochastic fluctuations, posing challenges for accurate prediction. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel multi-step ahead approach for cloud server aging prediction. Firstly, the original aging time series data is denoised using discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) and then reconstructed into multi-dimensional data by phase state reconstruction (PSR) to capture potential aging patterns. Subsequently, a deep long short-term memory network (DLSTM) is developed to predict the aging trend. Additionally, a stacked auto-encoder LSTM (SAE-LSTM) is designed to optimize the initial weight matrix of DLSTM to enhance prediction abilities. Finally, multi-step prediction experiments are conducted on our time series datasets from OpenStack cloud servers and a public dataset from Alibaba Cluster Trace Program. The comparative analysis of the proposed method with five baseline methods confirms its superiority in terms of prediction accuracy. For response time and free memory test sets, the range of root mean square error (RMSE) values are produced by the proposed method distributed in [0.1688–0.1931] and [139.05–146.05] respectively, with respect to the multi-step ahead prediction horizon from 1 up to 10. These results demonstrate that the proposed method can tackle the limitations of one-step ahead prediction, effectively extracting relevant aging features, and achieving low prediction accuracy.

If left unresolved, this problem may escalate to more severe consequences such as system crashes and downtime, significantly diminishing the availability and reliability of the system. In order to address the software aging and restore system performance, it has become an urgent problem to accurately determine the aging state of the Docker platform and generate targeted rejuvenation operations reasonably and effectively. Therefore, this paper proposes a synthesis method for determining the aging state and generating rejuvenation operations, named FOQL. Firstly, the FS-OWA algorithm is employed to analyze resource usage according to the varying degrees of aging states, accurately determining whether the system is in an aging state. Secondly, if the system enters an aging state, the Q- Learning algorithm evaluates the value of each rejuvenation operation based on the degree of aging and the cost of rejuvenation operations (such as downtime), ultimately generating the optimal operation. Finally, the experimental results show that, in determining the aging state, the recognition accuracy of the FS-OWA algorithm reached 99.3%, surpassing baseline algorithms by up to 16.52 %. In generating rejuvenation operations, Q-learning algorithm generates a Q-table containing the value of each state-action pair.

However, prolonged high-load operation of Cloud-Edge collaborative system may result in software aging, significantly impacting the reliability of the Cloud-Edge collaborative system, especially in resource-constrained edge environments. Proactive rejuvenation can help restore system robustness, but it comes with costs and affects normal system operation. Determining the appropriate rejuvenation timing and implementing an efficient rejuvenation strategy are crucial. Since the reliability of the edge system is closely related to the stable operation of the entire Cloud-Edge collaborative system, this paper proposes a comprehensive rejuvenation model named SM-OLR. This model calculates the rejuvenation time for the edge system and performs the rejuvenation operation, which is divided into two stages. The first stage involves determining the rejuvenation timing. A Semi-Markov model is used to represent the system state. Specific distribution functions are fitted based on measured values to accurately describe the system's state transitions. This enables a more scientific modeling of the system's state and ensures precise calculation of rejuvenation timing. The second stage focuses on the rejuvenation strategy. In the Cloud-Edge collaborative environment, interactions between edge and cloud, and edge and edge are easily facilitated, making task offloading a highly effective rejuvenation method. The paper adopts task offloading as the rejuvenation strategy. The reinforcement learning algorithm SARSA is employed to dynamically decide the offloading decision for specific tasks. Experiments were conducted in KubeEdge, a representative Cloud-Edge system. The results demonstrate that SM-OLR incurs lower rejuvenation overhead compared to traditional reboot rejuvenation, and the edge system can continue to provide services during the rejuvenation process.

Each service is thus replicated into a pool of identical replicas. This allows for load distribution among the pool of replicas and a greater degree of fault tolerance compared to a single instance of the service that stands as a single point of failure. The high availability and scalability requirements, coupled with the phenomenon of software aging, have made the replica-based approach pervasive in modern online services. In such configurations, the unavailability of a single replica, due to scheduled maintenance or unexpected failures, does not imply the unavailability of the whole system but rather an increase in the load of the remaining replicas. This identifies a performability problem in which the system can tolerate a certain number of offline replicas in the pool. However, once a certain threshold is exceeded, the resulting high workload pending on the online replicas could degrade the performance of the system, potentially leading to a failure in meeting the non-functional requirements.In this work, we study the problem of aging in a pool of service replicas. We characterize two inspection-based rejuvenation strategies that could be implemented in this context, which we identify as uncoordinated and coordinated rejuvenation. We represent them through the formalism of Stochastic Time Petri Nets (STPN) and through steady-state analysis, we conduct a performability evaluation of both the models as the frequency of inspections and the pool size vary.",ISSREW,model-based,云

Here, the scalability requirement is the average workload response time plus three standard deviations of response time, measured at low load. In addition, we plot, for each experiment sample, the instantaneous available memory and normalized distance of response time from the scalability requirement. We have also parameterized the discrete-time embedded Markov chain with rewards for each experiment, using a discrete representation of the available memory as the Markov chain state variable, and, the normalized distance from the scalability requirement as the state reward. Coloring the states of the Markov chain state transition diagram enabled new insights into the software aging and rejuvenation process, for each strategy, and software rejuvenation granularity level. We conclude by presenting an optimal synthetic resiliency strategy that was derived using Markov decision processes (MDPs).

In practice, software aging prediction has proven to be useful in planning the time to trigger rejuvenation because it provides a prior estimate of future resource consumption. However, aging indicators (e.g., physical memory) in cloud may have the characteristics of long-term slow growth, medium-term seasonality variations (alternating peaks and troughs), and short-term irregular fluctuations. Unfortunately, most of the existing aging prediction methods (e.g., a statistical or single machine learning model) only focus on the accuracy of short-term prediction, while lacking the cognition of the medium and long-term variations of aging indicators and their functions in formulating the rejuvenation schedule (e.g., performing rejuvenation when the load is low can minimize interference to users). To address the above problems, this article proposes a novel hybrid aging prediction framework to work on the prediction of memory resource consumption in cloud by applying a seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on loess (STL) method and Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network, called the decomposition-based GRU (DGRU). The effectiveness of DGRU mainly has two aspects. One is the STL method as a preprocessing technology that can extract the trend, seasonality, and residual characteristics from memory utilization data. The other is that these characteristics can be well predicted separately by a well-designed GRU model, which can model the time-series relationship between the data. Experimental results show that our DGRU framework has superior performance compared with its competitors, including seven single models and six hybrid models. Our study illustrates that the DGRU is a promising solution for high-precision software aging prediction.",TETC,Measurement-based（ML）,虚拟化系统

Based on the prediction results, software teams can allocate limited testing resources to ARB-prone modules. Previous research has proposed several methods for both within-project and cross-project ARB prediction. However, they are based on the same set of metrics focusing on the contents of a single module, and only six metrics are aging-related.

In response to the problems of poor universality, low prediction accuracy, and lack of research on cloud platform in train control system that exist in traditional aging analysis methods and prediction models, based on Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA), Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) and Time Convolution Network (TCN), a hybrid prediction model for virtual machine (VM) operation data on cloud platform is proposed. First, the original data is decomposed using the VMD optimized by SSA, and then each component is predicted using the SE-TCN model. Finally, use a fully connected network (FC) to fuse each component to obtain the final cloud resource usage prediction result. The analysis of the collected operational data shows that the prediction accuracy of the hybrid model is improved by 22% for Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and 27% for Mean Absolute Error (MAE), compared with that of other models, it has high prediction accuracy.",CAC,Measurement-based（ML）,VM（云计算）RBC

Software rejuvenation – the technique typically used to counteract aging – may compromise the user’s perception of availability and reliability of the personal device, if applied at a coarse grain, e.g., by restarting applications or, worse, rebooting the entire device. This article proposes a configurable micro-rejuvenation technique to counteract software aging in Android-based mobile devices, acting at a fine-grained level, namely on in-memory system data structures. The technique is engineered in two phases. Before releasing the (customized) Android version, a heap profiling facility is used by the manufacturer’s developers to identify potentially bloating data structures in Android services and to instrument their code. After release, an aging detection and rejuvenation service will safely clean up the bloating data structures, with a negligible impact on user perception and device availability, as neither the device nor operating system’s processes are restarted. The results of experiments show the ability of the technique to provide significant gains in aging mobile operating system responsiveness and time to failure.",JSS,rej,Android

Fault injection is an effective methodology for validating components that are supposed to detect the malfunctions and report/correct them. This paper studies the effectiveness of Kubernetes in dealing with faults and aging in microservices, and on the possibility of using faults to accelerate aging effects for testing purposes. For this, we conducted an analysis of the implementation and tuning of Kubernetes probes, followed by experiments with varying load and fault injection into two distinct and representative microservice testbeds to analyze the capacity of probes in detecting issues in applications. The goal is to improve the knowledge of researchers and developers on whether Kubernetes can detect different faults and aging issues. Also, even though some services tend to accumulate aging effects, with increasing resource consumption, Kubernetes does not detect them nor acts on them, indicating that probes may be insufficient for aging scenarios.

VampOS performs component-level rejuvenation of the unikernel by logging interactions between the components and replaying them to restarted components while simultaneously keeping the linked applications running.

The use of multiple concurrent GEN timers allows more accurate fitting of duration distributions from observed statistics (e.g., mean and variance), as well as better model expressiveness, enabling the formulation of mixed rejuvenation strategies that combine time-triggered and event-triggered rejuvenation. We leverage the functions for regenerative analysis based on stochastic state classes of the ORIS tool (through its SIRIO library) to evaluate this class of models and to select the rejuvenation period achieving an optimal tradeoff between two steady-state metrics, availability and undetected failure probability.

Its occurrence will lead to poor responsiveness or crash/hang failure of the system. Recently, the strategies to schedule rejuvenation are marching toward a situation that needs to consider both usage behavioral aspects of its users (i.e., switch between active and sleep modes) and two-level software aging process (i.e., Operating System (OS) and Application Software (AS)), because rejuvenating the OS or AS during active time slot contributes to terrible user experience. To be able to achieve higher user experience and lower user interference, in this paper, we present to employ the Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) model to study the impact of software aging and rejuvenation on user experience on two different rejuvenation strategies: condition-based and time-based rejuvenations. In contrast to the existing works, our models capture the interactions between usage behavioral aspects of users and two-level aging and rejuvenation. We then define three metrics to evaluate the user experience, including User-perceived (1) Fluency (UF), (2) Failure Probability (UFP), and (3) Availability (UA). The numerical analysis has the following noticed conclusions. The optimal value of UF yielded by condition-based rejuvenation reaches a 3.486% improvement over that of time-based. Therefore, the former is an appealing rejuvenation solution. Moreover, compared with single-level (OS and AS) rejuvenation models, two-level rejuvenation indeed improves the user experience.

Operations such as resource allocation, instantiation, monitoring, scaling, or termination of virtual functions are key lifecycle operations that NFV management and orchestration (NFV-MANO) frameworks need to correctly perform. Failures of the NFV-MANO prevent the network ability to respond to new service requests or events related to the normal lifecycle operation of network services. Thus, it is important to ensure robustness and high availability of the MANO framework. This paper adopts a model-driven approach to predict the availability of the NFV-MANO and assess the impact that different failure modes have. We propose different models, based on Stochastic Activity Networks (SANs), which abstract various MANO deployment configurations, inspired by current containerized open-source MANO implementations. Moreover, we integrate software rejuvenation and investigate the trade-off between its associated overhead and system availability increase. An extensive experimental campaign with fault-injection techniques on a real-life MANO implementation allows to derive a number of realistic recovery parameters. The case studies are used to quantitatively evaluate the steady-state availability and identify the most important parameters influencing system availability for the different deployment configurations.",TNSM,model-based,SDN

In Software Defined Networking (SDN), for instance, the control plane functions of forwarding devices are outsourced to the controller. Softwarized network components are expected to provide uninterrupted service during long periods of time, which makes them prone to the effects of software aging, a phenomena that has been observed in operational software systems where the failure rate increases or the performance of the software degrades with the elapsed time since the last restart. The effects of software aging in operational networks are typically mitigated by software rejuvenation, i.e., planned restarts cleaning the internal system state in order to prevent or postpone aging-related failures. This article presents ARES, a three-step methodological framework for the management of the effects of software aging in softwarized networks, applied to the case study of open source SDN orchestration platforms. Using ARES, we demonstrate that software aging is a systematic problem that cannot be neglected in network orchestration systems. It stems not only from aging-related bugs and natural aging due to fragmentation, but also from design choices, e.g., when implementing distributed systems. Measurements for Open Network Operating System (ONOS) and OpenDaylight (ODL) demonstrate how “simple” and common networking tasks let network performance degrade rapidly and even lead to crashes: for instance, adding and removing 300 intents per second in ONOS significantly increases the response time by 50% per day and depletes the memory at the rate of 18GB per day. Moreover, we demonstrate a first rejuvenation approach that can mitigate the effects of aging in ONOS.",TNSM,Measurement-based（阈值）,SDN

Failures in the software development process may impact these attributes. Flawed code and overall software misdesign may cause internal errors, leading to system malfunction. Some errors might be identified and fixed during the software testing process. However, other errors may manifest only during the production stage. This is the case of the software aging phenomenon, which is related to the progressive degradation that a software performance or reliability suffers during its operational life. This paper proposes a methodology for software maintenance that is tailored to identify, correct, and mitigate the software aging effects. If the source code can be modified and a new version deployed with minimal impact, thus data from aging detection is used for corrective maintenance, i.e., for fixing the bug that causes the aging effects. If the software cannot be fixed nor its version updated without long system interruption or other bad consequences, then our approach can mitigate the aging effects, in a preventive maintenance to avoid service outages. The proposed methodology is validated through both Stochastic Petri Net (SPN) models and experiments in a controlled environment. The model evaluation considering a hybrid maintenance routine (preventive and corrective) yielded an availability of 99.82%, representing an annual downtime of 15.9 hours. By contrast, the baseline scenario containing only reactive maintenance (i.e., repairing only after failure) had more than 1342 hours of annual downtime- 80 times higher than the proposed approach.",SysCon,Model-based,非特定的

In practice, the labeled data are rare in many cases. In addition, it is difficult to label all samples manually. Furthermore, there is a serious class imbalance problem in ARBs datasets. In order to address the two problems, we propose a framework named QUIRE-HUE. On the one hand, we use a approach named Active Learning by Querying Informative and Representative Examples (QUIRE) to select a few informative and representative samples to label for training set, which can reduce the cost of labeling and get a high performance classification model. On the other hand, we apply a Hashing-Based Undersampling Ensemble (HUE) by constructing diversified training subspaces for undersampling to alleviate class imbalance problem. A set of experiments are performed on two large open-source projects (MySQL, Linux) with six different machine learning classifiers. We use Balance and AUC as the evaluation metrics.

We were able to analytically evaluate the transient failure probability and the associated Instantaneous Expected Energy Not Supplied metric, for each of the four case studies, from one specific attack. We envision several practical applications of the proposed methodology.

Because of the low presence and reproducing difficulty of ARBs, collecting enough training data to predict ARBs in a project is not easy. Thus, cross-project ARB prediction has been proposed. There are two main challenges in cross-project ARB prediction, namely distribution differences and severe class imbalance. As for the first challenge, existing cross-project ARB prediction approaches only focus on the transferability between domains while ignoring the discriminability between classes. As for the second challenge, existing approaches only consider the imbalance between the classes while ignoring the within-class imbalance problem. To solve these problems, a cross-project ARB prediction approach based on Joint Probability Domain Adaptation (JPDA) and k- means SMOTE (KS), called JPKS, is proposed. JPDA is used to consider the transferability and discriminability simultaneously, and KS solves the within-class and between-class imbalance problems.

It refers to the increase of failure rates or the decline of performance in a long-running software system, mainly caused by Aging-Related Bugs (ARBs). Failure incurred by software aging may cause economic loss and may lead to casualties in security-critical systems. Automatic classification of ARB reports is an effective method to ensure the software system's quality by helping us detect and fix the bugs in software systems. There are two challenges in the automatic classification of ARB reports at present. Firstly, it is difficult to distinguish the ARB reports since the semantics of the text is ambiguous and hard to be recognized; secondly, the number of ARB reports is much smaller than other types of bugs, which may lead to class imbalance. Therefore, An ARB Report Automatic Classification Method based on BERT(ARB-BERT) is proposed in this paper to alleviate these problems. We combined back-translation, random under-sampling and random over-sampling to reduce the class imbalance problem in classification. By considering the ARB reports' characteristics, we utilize BERT as the semantic model, extracting feature vectors containing more accurate and sufficient information.

To mitigate the aging effects and prevent serious losses caused by the system failure, software rejuvenations can be proactively performed to restore the system performance. This paper models and optimizes a state-based rejuvenation policy for software systems performing real-time computing tasks and undergoing periodic inspections. During each scheduled inspection, the system state is evaluated and the decision about the rejuvenation is made based on the evaluated system state and a rejuvenation decision function. The time of each rejuvenation procedure (corresponding to the system downtime) depends on the system state as well as on the amount of task operations accomplished before deciding to perform the rejuvenation. As the rejuvenation policy determines the time and number of rejuvenations performed during the task processing, it can affect the probability that the system can accomplish the real-time task by a certain deadline significantly. In this work, we optimize the state-based rejuvenation policy to maximize the probability of task completion (PTC) of periodically inspected software systems. The methodology encompasses an event transition-based iterative method proposed for quantifying the PTC and application of the Genetic Algorithm for deriving the optimal rejuvenation policy. Examples are presented to demonstrate the proposed methodology and influences of several parameters (e.g., inspection interval, rejuvenation time) on the optimization results.",RESS,model-based,非特定的

We derive the optimal state-based rejuvenation policy minimizing the total expected mission cost for software aging systems subject to multiple performance degradation states. The solution encompasses an event transition-based numerical method that assesses the total expected mission cost of a real-time task, covering penalty cost from the mission failure, operation cost of running the mission software and the expected rejuvenation cost. The proposed cost evaluation model can accommodate arbitrary types of state transition time distributions. The suggested model also allows simultaneous evaluations of other system performance metrics including the probability of the successful task completion (i.e., mission reliability) and conditional expected mission completion time given a successful mission task.

It works by proactively terminating the system, cleaning the internal state of the system, and restarting the system. Since rejuvenation incurs extra system overhead and downtime cost, it is important to determine the optimal time to trigger rejuvenation. This paper proposes a two-layer model to characterize the system failure behavior and rejuvenation process under aging condition, planning a time-based rejuvenation policy maximizing the system availability and minimizing downtime cost. The lower layer is a failure model that uses an analytical model and runtime measurements to build the failure distribution of the aging system. The upper layer is a rejuvenation model that takes the failure distribution from the lower layer as input to formulate the availability function and downtime cost function. Taking these two functions as optimization targets, we can obtain the optimal rejuvenation time. Compared with the traditional analytical model, the two-layer model modeling software failure considers runtime measurements, which can describe the aging behavior more accurately. In the experimental part, we comprehensively evaluate the two-layer model by studying the aging of the web search system. The results show that the two-layer model reduces unavailability by 18.18% and reduces downtime cost by 31.22% in comparison with the traditional analytical model.",IEEE Access,Hybrid,网络搜索系统

Software rejuvenation techniques can be adopted to reduce the impact of software aging. Although there existed analytical model-based approaches for evaluating software rejuvenation techniques, none analyzed both application service (AS) availability and job completion time in a virtualized system with live virtual machine (VM) migration. This paper aims to quantitatively analyze software rejuvenation techniques from service provider and user views in a virtualized system deploying VMM reboot and live VM migration techniques for rejuvenation, under the condition that all the aging time, failure time, VMM fixing time and live VM migration time follow general distributions. We construct an analytical model by using a semi-Markov process (SMP) and derive formulas for calculating AS availability and job completion time. By analytical experiments, we can obtain the optimal migration trigger intervals for achieving the approximate maximum AS availability and the approximate minimum job completion time, and then service providers can make decisions for maximizing the benefits of service providers and users by adjusting parameter values.",IEEE Access,Model-based,VMM

In order to make rejuvenation more efficient, identifying the aging state of Android system precisely is the key point. In this paper, we propose a novel Android system aging state detection method based on the Boundary Equilibrium Generative Adversarial Network (BEGAN) and state clustering technology, which is named as GAN-ASD.

To counteract the aging effect, software rejuvenation is widely implemented to restore the performance of a degraded system before the system crash actually takes place. To facilitate an effective system function restoration after each rejuvenation action, it is desirable to apply checkpointing to occasionally save the system state on a reliable storage so that the mission task can be resumed from the last saved checkpoint (instead of being restarted from the very beginning). As both rejuvenation and checkpointing procedures incur system overhead while bringing these benefits, it is significant to determine the optimal rejuvenation and checkpointing scheduling policy optimizing the system performance measures of interest. This paper makes new contributions by modeling and optimizing the joint maintenance policy involving state-based rejuvenation and periodic checkpointing schedule for software systems performing real-time computing tasks. The system can undergo multiple performance degradation levels or states, and transition time between different states can assume arbitrary types of distributions. The proposed solution methodology encompasses an efficient numerical algorithm for evaluating the probability of task completion (PTC) by a pre-specified deadline. The joint optimal rejuvenation and checkpointing policy is further determined to maximize the PTC of the considered real-time task.

The effectiveness of this approach is validated and evaluated by nine groups of experiments on real software systems. Major conclusions from the experiments include the following: first, TLAP improves cross-project ARB prediction on average compared with traditional machine learning methods; second, utilizing information from multiple-projects can further improve the prediction performance on average.

ARB prediction can help developers discover and remove ARBs, thus alleviating the impact of software aging. However, ARB-prone files occupy a small percentage of all the analyzed files. It is usually difficult to gather sufficient ARB data within a project. To overcome the limited availability of training data, several researchers have recently developed cross-project models for ARB prediction. A key point for cross-project models is to learn a good representation for instances in different projects. Nevertheless, most of the previous approaches neither consider the reconstruction property of new representation nor encode source samples' label information in learning representation. To address these shortcomings, we propose a Supervised Representation Learning Approach (SRLA), which is based on double encoding-layer autoencoder, to perform cross-project ARB prediction. Moreover, we present a transfer cross-validation framework to select the hyper-parameters of cross-project models.

Experimental results reveal that the random under-sampling approach performs best followed by RUSBoost in-terms of the mean AUC metric. Statistical significance test demonstrates that there is a significant difference between the performance of the various feature selection techniques.

Aging related failures (ARFs) are the result of a variety of complex factors. Therefore, how to precisely predict the ARFs for a running software system is a challenge problem. Previous studies typically predict ARFs by means of predicting the time to resource exhaustion (TTE), which adopts resource data as aging indicators to predict when the resource data achieve the preset threshold. However, the practical effect of prior approaches are far from satisfactory due to lack of effective aging indicators and difficult to set accurate threshold. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach, which combines model and measurements to construct a probabilistic aging indicator. The aging indicator is a multifactorial aging indicator that is more effective than traditional ones. Moreover, the hybrid approach is threshold-free in ARFs prediction.

The normal system performance can be recovered by software rejuvenation, which restarts the software system to clear all the internal error states due to software aging. Since software rejuvenation drops all the jobs in the system, a trigger for software rejuvenation needs to be carefully determined in consideration of such costs. In this paper, we theoretically derive the optimal policy that minimizes the cost of decision for software rejuvenation in a deteriorating job processing system, which is modeled as an M/M/1 queue with infinite buffer size. In our model, the number of queued jobs is used to represent the system state and the decision of rejuvenation is made upon the completion of a foreground job. We formulate the problem as an optimal stopping problem to analytically derive the optimal policy for the rejuvenation decision. The analytical results show that the optimal stopping policy is determined by the service degradation rate, the costs of dropped jobs and delayed jobs, and it does not depend on the number of queued jobs. This indicates that whether to trigger rejuvenation can be decided immediately when the system confirms the level of service degradation, regardless of the number of queued jobs at that time instant.",RESS,model-based,非特定的

Ever since the notion of software aging was introduced, lots of researches have devoted in studying software aging empirically by learning aging trend under controlled experiments. However, we notice that how software aging evolves within online system is seldom covered in the literature. To fill the blank and improve usability of software-aging works, we in this paper propose an approach to detect aberrant software aging in online system, i.e., servers grow old more quickly or slowly than the rest servers. We believe studying aberrant aging can contribute to better understanding of software aging in real world. The mechanism utilizes random sliding windows over LOF (Local Outlier Factor) algorithm to analyze the CPU and workload indicators, which displays good accuracy and recall rate in a real world application. Moreover, we analyze how the software trend to age aberrantly and verify if aberrant aging also obeys the rules in controlled experiment. We conclude three aging patterns from these aberrant aging servers, and find out CPU-oriented indicators shows higher precision and recall rate than memory-oriented in analyzing software aging.",ICSESS,Measurement-based（ML）,web服务器

To guarantee the high availability and minimize the maintenance cost in the cloud-based system, a cost-effective rejuvenation policy is proposed based on cumulative damage model (CDM) in this paper. With our proposal, prior to system failure diagnosis, the system is managed to be rejuvenated either at a predetermined time or at a damage threshold level, whichever occurs first.

This policy mitigates the negative impact of two-level software aging. The two levels considered are the user-level applications and the operating system. A Markov regenerative process model is constructed based on the system condition. We obtain the degradation rate of the application software and operating system from fault injection experiments. The diagnostic accuracy of the adopted monitor and analysis system, which is applied to inspect the application software and operating system, is considered as we provide the optimal rejuvenation strategies. Finally, the availability and the overall loss probability with their corresponding optimal inspection time intervals are obtained numerically based on the parameter values estimated from the experiments. Experimental results show that two-granularity software rejuvenation is much more effective than traditional single-level software rejuvenation.

These chronic problems often fly under the radar of software monitoring systems before causing severe impacts (e.g., system failures). Therefore, it is a challenging issue how to timely predict the occurrence of failures caused by these problems. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of prior approaches are far from satisfactory due to the insufficiency of aging indicators adopted by them. To accurately predict failures caused by software aging which are named as Aging-Related Failure (ARFs), this paper presents a novel entropy-based aging indicator, namely Multidimensional Multi-scale Entropy (MMSE) which leverages the complexity embedded in runtime performance metrics to indicate software aging. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to leverage entropy to predict ARFs. Based upon MMSE, we implement three failure prediction approaches encapsulated in a proof-of-concept prototype named ARF-Predictor. The experimental evaluations in a Video on Demand (VoD) system, and in a real-world production system, AntVision, show that ARF-Predictor can predict ARFs with a very high accuracy and a low Ahead-Time-To-Failure (ATTF). Compared to previous approaches, ARF-Predictor improves the prediction accuracy by about 5 times and reduces ATTF even by 3 orders of magnitude. In addition, ARF-Predictor is light-weight enough to satisfy the real-time requirement.",TDSC,度量,视频点播系统与真实世界生产系统

In this paper, we develop a reliability analysis model for redundant cluster systems consisting of initial servers and cold standby servers used to replace failed ones. System reliability process is modeled with a state-based non-homogeneous Markov process (NHMH), where each state corresponds to a non-homogeneous Poisson processe (NHPP). NHPP arrival rate is expressed using Cox's proportional hazard model (PHM) in terms of cumulative and instantaneous workload of system software.

These service-oriented applications often operate continuously, which exposes the software to ""aging"" where resource deterioration such as memory leaks can lead resource exhaustion and ultimately system failure. To mitigate the impact of aging, software rejuvenation refreshes or restarts the system periodically to recover lost resources, thereby averting failures. Software rejuvenation may also employ fault tolerance to reduce the impact of individual failures on system availability. However, virtually all previous software rejuvenation studies assume that failures experienced by the individual servers comprising a fault tolerant system are statistically independent. This paper analyzes the impact of correlated failures on the optimality of rejuvenation schedules for a system composed of two parallel servers that can experience correlated failures. The examples illustrate the impact of correlation on the optimality of rejuvenation schedules to maximize availability and minimize down time cost. The results indicate that increasing the correlation between the failures of the servers increases the rejuvenation period when the objective is to maximize availability. However, the rejuvenation period decreases when the objective is to minimize down time cost. Thus, the proposed approach can objectively identify the optimal rejuvenation period that maximizes availability or minimizes down time cost.",RAMS,Model-based,服务器

Rejuvenation is one of the most commonly used approaches to handle issues caused by software aging. To combat resource performance degradation and at the same time maintain maximized average resource performance, we present a two-level rejuvenation strategy, i.e., interleaving a set of n warm rejuvenations with one cold rejuvenation. Our target is to find the optimal n that maximizes system average performance. We first define a resource model that takes into consideration of performance degradation and two-level rejuvenations. Based on the resource model, we formally analyze the resource supply and present the MAX-PERFORMANCE algorithm to determine the optimal rejuvenation pattern that maximizes the average resource performance. The simulation results show that with a two-level rejuvenation strategy, we can achieve 25.22% higher average resource performance compared with a single level rejuvenation strategy.",HPCC,rej; Model-based,Android

Trivedi,Performance Evaluation,212-230,3,70,Elsevier BV,,,2013-3,"As server virtualization is used in a number of IT systems, the unavailability of virtual machines (VM) on server virtualized systems becomes a significant concern. Software rejuvenation is a promising technique for improving the availability of server virtualized systems as it can postpone or prevent failures caused by software aging in both the VM and the underlying virtual machine monitor (VMM). In this paper, we study the effectiveness of a combination of VMM rejuvenation and live VM migration. When a VMM needs to be rejuvenated, the hosted VMs running on the VMM can be moved to another host using live VM migration and continue the execution even during the VMM rejuvenation. We call this technique Migrate-VM rejuvenation and construct an availability model in the stochastic reward net for evaluating it in comparison with the conventional approaches; Cold-VM rejuvenation and Warm-VM rejuvenation. The designed model enables us to find the optimum combinations of rejuvenation trigger intervals that maximize the availability of VM. In terms of the maximum VM availability, Migrate-VM rejuvenation is potentially the best approach. However, the advantage of Migrate-VM rejuvenation depends on the type of live VM migration (stop-and-copy or pre-copy) and the policy for migration back to the original host after VMM rejuvenation (return-back or stay-on). Through numerical examples, we show that “pre-copy” live VM migration is encouraged rather than pure “stop-and-copy” migration and it is better to return back VM to the original host soon after the VMM rejuvenation (i.e., “return-back” rather than “stay-on” policy) for high-availability.

Fast and accurate detection of aging is important for eliminating the underlying defects already during software development and testing. Also in a deployment scenario, aging detection is needed to plan mitigation methods like software rejuvenation. The goal of this paper is to evaluate whether the Mann-Kendall test is an effective approach for detecting software aging from traces of computer system metrics. This technique tests for existence of monotonic trends in time series, and studies of software aging often consider existence of trends in certain metrics as indication of software aging. Through an experimental study we show that the Mann-Kendall test is highly vulnerable to creating false positives in context of aging detection. By increasing the amount of data considered in the test, the false positive rate can be reduced; however, time to detect aging increases considerably. Our findings indicate that aging detection using the Mann-Kendall test alone is in general unreliable, or may require long measurement times.",ISSREW,度量,Linux

Trivedi,2013 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE),61-70,,,IEEE,,2013 IEEE 24th International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering (ISSRE),2013-11,"Continuous or high availability is a key requirement for many modern IT systems. Computer operating systems play an important role in IT systems availability. Due to the complexity of their architecture, they are prone to suffer failures due to several types of software faults. Software aging causes a nonnegligible fraction of these failures. It leads to an accumulation of errors with time, increasing the system failure rate. This phenomenon can be accompanied by performance degradation and eventually system hang or even crash. As a countermeasure, software rejuvenation entails stopping the system, cleaning its internal state, and resuming its operation. This process usually incurs downtime. For an operating system, the downtime impacts any application running on top of it. Several solutions have been developed to speed up the boot time of operating systems in order to reduce the downtime overhead. We present a study of two fast OS reboot techniques for rejuvenation of Linux-based operating systems, namely Kexec and Phase-based reboot. The study measures the performance penalty they introduce and the gain in reduction of downtime overhead. The results reveal that the Kexec and Phase-based reboot have no statistically significant impact in terms of performance penalty from the user perspective. However, they may require extra resource (e.g., CPU) usage. The downtime overhead reduction, compared with normal Linux and VM reboots, is 77% and 79% in Kexec and Phase-based reboot, respectively.",ISSRE,rej,OS（Linux）

Since a VMM is fundamental software for running VMs, its performance degradation or crash failure affects all VMs running on top of it. To counteract such software aging, a proactive technique called software rejuvenation has been proposed. A simple example of rejuvenation is to reboot a VMM. However, simply rebooting a VMM is undesirable because that needs rebooting operating systems on all VMs. In this paper, we propose a new technique for fast rejuvenation of VMMs called the warm-VM reboot. The warm-VM reboot enables efficiently rebooting only a VMM by suspending and resuming VMs without saving the memory images to persistent storage. To achieve this, we have developed two mechanisms: on-memory suspend/resume of VMs and quick reload of a VMM. Compared with a normal reboot, the warm-VM reboot reduced the downtime by 74 percent at maximum. It also prevented the performance degradation due to cache misses after the reboot, which was 52 percent in case of a normal reboot. In a cluster environment, the warm-VM reboot achieved higher total throughput than the system using VM migration and a normal reboot.",TDSC,rej,虚拟化系统&集群

Numerous experiments have been carried out in the last decade to empirically analyze software aging. Such experiments, besides highlighting the relevance of the phenomenon, have shown that aging is tightly related to the applied workload. However, due to the differences among the experimented applications and among the experimental conditions, results of past studies are not comparable to each other. This prevent from drawing general conclusions (e.g., about the aging-workload relationship), and from comparing systems from the aging perspective. In this paper, we propose a procedure to carry out aging experiments in different applications for: i) assessing aging trend of the individual systems, as well as assessing differences among them (i.e., obtaining comparable results), ii) inferring workload-aging relationships from experiments performed on different applications, by highlighting the most relevant workload parameters.

To counteract this phenomenon, a preventive approach to fault management, called software rejuvenation has been proposed. In this paper, we propose a framework which provides transparent and predictive software rejuvenation to web services that suffer software aging on virtualized platforms, achieving high levels of availability.

One of the main reasons for CRL's unavailability is the CA's server unavailability. In this paper we innovatively propose to adopt software rejuvenation to reduce the probability that CA's cannot issue the CRL.

Aging-related failures are very difficult to observe, because the accumulation of aging effects usually requires a long-term execution. Thus, collecting a statistically significant sample of times to aging-related failures so as to estimate the system's lifetime distribution is a very hard task. This is an important problem that prevents many experimental and analytical studies, mainly those focused on modeling of software aging aspects, of using representative parameter values. In this paper we propose and evaluate the use of quantitative accelerated life tests (QALT) to reduce the time to obtain the lifetime distribution of systems that fail due to software aging. Since QALT was developed for hardware failures, in this paper, we adapt it to software aging experiments. We test the proposed approach experimentally, estimating the lifetime distribution of a real web server system. The accuracy of the estimated distribution is evaluated by comparing its reliability estimates with a sample of failure times observed from the real system under test. The mean time to failure calculated from the real sample falls inside the 90% confidence interval constructed from the estimated lifetime distribution, demonstrating the high accuracy of the estimated model.

Virtualization allows multiple operating system instances to run concurrently on a single physical machine. In this paper, we map virtualization based software rejuvenation approach with Markov Chain process and get mathematical steady-state solutions of the chain. We model multiple physical servers which are used to host multiple virtual machines (VMs) using stochastic modeling and evaluate it through both numerical analysis and SHARPE (Symbolic Hierarchical Automated Reliability and Performance Evaluator) tool simulation. The numerical results show that software rejuvenation and virtualization can be used to prolong the availability of the services and reduce the downtime of the systems.",SSIRI,Model-based,托管多个虚拟机（VM）的物理服务器

Analytic models using the well known paradigm of Markov chains are used. Since the size of the Markov model is nontrivial, automated specification generation, and the solution via stochastic Petri nets is utilized. Deterministic time to trigger rejuvenation is approximated by a 20-stage Erlangian distribution. Based on the numerical solutions of the models, we find that under the given context, although the fixed rejuvenation occasionally yields a higher throughput, the delayed rejuvenation policy seems to outperform fixed rejuvenation policy by up to 11%. We also compare the steady-state system availabilities of these two rejuvenation policies.",PRDC,Model-based,cluster system

This self-healing scheme is meant to disrupt the running service for a minimal amount of time, achieving zero downtime in most cases. In our scheme, we exploit the usage of virtualization to optimize the self-recovery actions. The techniques described in this paper have been tested with a set of open-source Linux tools and the XEN virtualization middleware.

This method works for a large class of the aging processes caused by resource depletion (e.g. memory leaks). It can be deployed non-intrusively in a production environment, under arbitrary service request distributions. Based on this schema we investigate in the second part of the paper how machine learning (classification) algorithms can be used for proactive detection of performance degradation or sudden drops caused by aging. We leverage the predictive power of these algorithms with several techniques to make the measurement-based aging models more adaptive and more robust against transient failures. We evaluate several state-of-the-art classification methods for their accuracy and computational efficiency in this scenario. The studies are performed on a data set generated by a TPC-W benchmark instrumented with a memory leak injector. The results show that the probing method yields accurate aging models with low overhead and the machine learning approach gives statistically significant short-term predictions of degrading application performance.

Three rejuvenation policies, namely standard rejuvenation, delayed rejuvenation and mixed rejuvenation, are designed to improve the cluster’s performability under varying workload. Analytic models are built to evaluate these three policies. Since deterministic transitions are used in this paper and analytical models based on homogeneous continuous-time Markov chains (CTMC) do not allow non-exponential distributions, we utilize deterministic and stochastic Petri nets (DSPN), in which the underlying stochastic process is a Markov regenerative process (MRGP), to capture both exponential and deterministic distributions. System performability measures under these three rejuvenation policies are derived based on the DSPN models. We show that the mixed rejuvenation policy achieves the maximum performability among the three policies, which results in 12% improvement on the system throughput in the example shown in this paper. The delayed rejuvenation is better than the standard rejuvenation with respect to the optimal job blocking probability and system throughput.

Causes of this phenomenon, which has been referred to as “software aging”, are the accumulation of internal error conditions, and the depletion of operating system resources. A proactive technique called “software rejuvenation” has been proposed as a way to counteract software aging. It involves occasionally terminating the software application, cleaning its internal state and/or its environment, and then restarting it. Due to the costs incurred by software rejuvenation, an important question is when to schedule this action. While periodic rejuvenation at constant time intervals is straightforward to implement, it may not yield the best results. The rate at which software ages is usually not constant, but it depends on the time-varying system workload. Software rejuvenation should therefore be planned & initiated in the face of the actual system behavior. This requires the measurement, analysis, and prediction of system resource usage. In this paper, we study the development of resource usage in a web server while subjecting it to an artificial workload. We first collect data on several system resource usage & activity parameters. Non-parametric statistical methods are then applied toward detecting & estimating trends in the data sets. Finally, we fit time series models to the data collected.

This phenomenon, which may eventually lead to system performance degradation and/or crash/hang failure, is the result of exhaustion of operating system resources, data corruption, and numerical error accumulation. To counteract software aging, a technique called software rejuvenation has been proposed, which essentially involves occasionally terminating an application or a system, cleaning its internal state and/or its environment, and restarting it. Since rejuvenation incurs an overhead, an important research issue is to determine optimal times to initiate this action. In this paper, we first describe how to include faults attributed to software aging in the framework of Gray's software fault classification (deterministic and transient), and study the treatment and recovery strategies for each of the fault classes. We then construct a semi-Markov reward model based on workload and resource usage data collected from the UNIX operating system. We identify different workload states using statistical cluster analysis, estimate transition probabilities, and sojourn time distributions from the data. Corresponding to each resource, a reward function is then defined for the model based on the rate of resource depletion in each state. The model is then solved to obtain estimated times to exhaustion for each resource. The result from the semi-Markov reward model are then fed into a higher-level availability model that accounts for failure followed by reactive recovery, as well as proactive recovery.

In this paper, we consider the optimal software rejuvenation policy maximizing the interval reliability in the general semi-Markov framework. We derive analytically the optimal software rejuvenation timing which maximizes the limiting interval reliability or the interval reliability with exponentially distributed operation times. Further, we examine numerically the transient behavior of the interval reliability at an arbitrary operation time.

Soc,,2002 International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering,2002,"A number of recent studies have reported the phenomenon of ""software aging"", characterized by progressive performance degradation or a sudden hang/crash of a software system due to exhaustion of operating system resources, fragmentation and accumulation of errors. To counteract this phenomenon, a proactive technique called ""software rejuvenation"" has been proposed. This essentially involves stopping the running software, cleaning its internal state and then restarting it. Software rejuvenation, being preventive in nature, begs the question as to when to schedule it. Periodic rejuvenation, while straightforward to implement, may not yield the best results. A better approach is based on actual measurement of system resource usage and activity that detects and estimates resource exhaustion times. Estimating the resource exhaustion times makes it possible for software rejuvenation to be initiated or better planned so that the system availability is maximized in the face of time-varying workload and system behavior. We propose a methodology based on time series analysis to detect and estimate resource exhaustion times due to software aging in a Web server while subjecting it to an artificial workload. We first collect and log data on several system resource usage and activity parameters on a Web server. Time-series ARMA models are then constructed from the data to detect aging and estimate resource exhaustion times. The results are then compared with previous measurement-based models and found to be more efficient and computationally less intensive. These models can be used to develop proactive management techniques like software rejuvenation which are triggered by actual measurements.",ESE,Measurement-based（时间序列）,web服务器（Apache）

The methodology is based on a fine grained model that assumes that it is possible to identify the current degradation level of the system by monitoring an observable quantity, so that the rejuvenation strategy can be tuned on the measured degradation. Based on this methodology, we present two different strategies that allow to decide whether and when to rejuvenate, and we exploit the theory of renewal processes with reward to estimate the steady-state unavailability of the software system, which is used to define an optimality criterion that allows us to evaluate the proper rejuvenation intervals.

Zeggert,IBM Journal of Research and Development,311-332,2,45,IBM,,,2001-3,"Software failures are now known to be a dominant source of system outages. Several studies and much anecdotal evidence point to “software aging” as a common phenomenon, in which the state of a software system degrades with time. Exhaustion of system resources, data corruption, and numerical error accumulation are the primary symptoms of this degradation, which may eventually lead to performance degradation of the software, crash/hang failure, or other undesirable effects. “Software rejuvenation” is a proactive technique intended to reduce the probability of future unplanned outages due to aging. The basic idea is to pause or halt the running software, refresh its internal state, and resume or restart it. Software rejuvenation can be performed by relying on a variety of indicators of aging, or on the time elapsed since the last rejuvenation. In response to the strong desire of customers to be provided with advance notice of unplanned outages, our group has developed techniques that dete ct the occurrence of software aging due to resource exhaustion, estimate the time remaining until the exhaustion reaches a critical level, and automatically perform proactive software rejuvenation of an application, process group, or entire operating system, depending on the pervasiveness of the resource exhaustion and our ability to pinpoint the source. This technology has been incorporated into the IBM Director for xSeries servers. To quantitatively evaluate the impact of different rejuvenation policies on the availability of cluster systems, we have developed analytical models based on stochastic reward nets (SRNs). For time-based rejuvenation policies, we determined the optimal rejuvenation interval based on system availability and cost. We also analyzed a rejuvenation policy based on prediction, and showed that it can further increase system availability and reduce downtime cost. These models are very general and can capture a multitude of cluster system characteristics, failure behavior, and performabil ity measures, which we are just beginning to explore.",IBM J RES DEV,Model-based,cluster system

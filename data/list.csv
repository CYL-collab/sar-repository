This expansion is particularly evident with the widespread adoption of large language models. Currently, the infrastructure supporting ML systems, such as cloud services and computing hardware, which are increasingly becoming foundational to the ML system environment, is increasingly adopted to support continuous training and inference services. Nevertheless, it has been shown that the increased data volume, complexity of computations, and extended run times challenge the stability of ML systems, efficiency, and availability, precipitating system aging. To address this issue, we develop a novel solution, KPAMA, leveraging Kubernetes, the leading container orchestration platform, to enhance the autoscaling of computing workflows and resources, effectively mitigating system aging. KPAMA employs a hybrid model to predict key aging metrics and uses decision and anti-oscillation algorithms to achieve system resource autoscaling. Our experiments indicate that KPAMA markedly mitigates system aging and enhances task reliability compared to the standard Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and systems without scaling capabilities.",JSS,measurement-based; other mitigation,深度学习系统; 虚拟化系统

The catastrophic consequences caused by these accidents make people realize the importance of software trustworthiness. As an indispensable means to ensure software quality, traditional trustworthiness measurement evaluates the software trustworthiness by studying the trustworthy attributes in a static way. However, most of the factors considered in trustworthy attributes tend to be dynamic with time. The current research often ignores the changes in software after running for some time, and cannot reflect the changes in software trustworthiness at different running times. Objective: Our objective in this paper is to study the relationship between running time and software trustworthiness, and design a running time-related software trustworthiness measurement model from the untrustworthy evidence related to software aging. Method: We first extract the untrustworthy evidence from the bugs related to software aging in 5 subsystems of 4 public defect databases and 18 well-known software accidents, establish a risk level model, and design metric elements of untrustworthy evidence based on software aging. Then we construct a software aging cause category trustworthiness measurement model based on Boltzmann entropy. Finally, we build a software trustworthiness measurement model based on weighted Boltzmann entropy. For the weight values used in the model, the Brassard Priority Synthesis Analysis method was used to determine them. Result: Different from the common resource consumption parameter and performance parameter, a model based on weighted Boltzmann entropy can describe the influence of various parameters on the software’s trustworthiness through risk state. It can reflect the change of system state and describe the system state completely. Conclusion: The empirical study shows the effectiveness and practicality of our method for evaluating software dynamic trustworthiness. Meanwhile, it also indicates a promising avenue for future research and application in the field of software trustworthiness measurement.",IST,UDN,非特定的

However, DL-based ARB prediction models face a dual challenge: overcoming overfitting to enhance generalization and managing the high labeling costs associated with extensive data requirements. To address the first issue, we utilize the sparse and binary nature of spiking communication in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which inherently provides brain-inspired regularization to effectively alleviate overfitting. Therefore, we propose a Spiking Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN)-based ARB prediction model along with a training framework that handles the model’s spatial-temporal dynamics and non-differentiable nature. To reduce labeling costs, we introduce a Bio-inspired and Diversity-aware Active Learning framework (BiDAL), which prioritizes highly informative and diverse samples, enabling more efficient usage of the limited labeling budget. This framework incorporates bio-inspired uncertainty to enhance informativeness measurement along with using a diversity-aware selection strategy based on clustering to prevent redundant labeling. Experiments on three ARB datasets show that ARB-SCNN effectively reduces overfitting, improving generalization performance by 6.65% over other DL-based classifiers. Additionally, BiDAL boosts label efficiency for ARB-SCNN training, outperforming four state-of-the-art active learning methods by 4.77% within limited labeling budgets.",TETC,PRE,Linux、MySQL、AXIS、HTTPD

We present the evaluation results obtained from measurement and modeling implementations. The measurement infrastructure was composed of 15 large and 15 extra-large VMs. The modeling approach used Markov Decision Processes (MDP). On the measurement testbed, we implemented three different levels of software rejuvenation granularity to achieve software resiliency. We have discovered two threats to resiliency in this environment. The first threat to resiliency was a memory leak that was part of the underlying open-source infrastructure in each VM. The second threat to resiliency was the result of the contention for resources in the physical host, which is dependent on the number and size of VMs deployed to the physical host. In the MDP modeling approach, we evaluated four strategies for assigning tasks to VMs with different configurations and different levels of parallelism. Using the large cluster under study, we compared our approach of using software aging and rejuvenation with the state-of-the-art approach of using a network of VMs deployed to a private cloud without software aging detection and rejuvenation. In summary, we show that in a private cloud with non-elastic resource allocation in the physical hosts, careful performance engineering needs to be performed to optimize the trade-offs between the number of VMs allocated and the total memory allocated to each VM.",TETC,model-based,虚拟化系统

Performance modeling uses queueing theory, specifically adopting an $M/G/m$M/G/m model with the Allen-Cunneen approximation, to capture real-world aspects related to service times. Availability modeling is addressed through the Multidimensional Universal Generating Function (MUGF), a recent technique that achieves computational efficiency when dealing with systems with many sub-elements, particularly useful for multi-provider service chains. Additionally, we deploy an experimental testbed based on the Open5GS service chain, to estimate key performance and availability parameters. Supported by experimental results, we evaluate the impact of rejuvenation on the performability of the Open5GS service chain. The numerical analysis shows that i) the configuration of replicas across nodes is important to meet availability goals; ii) rejuvenation can bring one additional “nine” of availability, depending on the time to recovery; and iii) MUGF can significantly reduce computational complexity through straightforward algebraic manipulations.",TETC,model-based,MEC-SFC

Various stochastic models of Software Aging and Rejuvenation (SAR) have been developed, mostly having an underlying stochastic process in the class of Continuous Time Markov Chains (CTMCs), Semi-Markov Processes (SMPs), and Markov Regenerative Processes (MRGPs) under the enabling restriction, requiring that at most one general (GEN), i.e., non-Exponential, timer be enabled in each state. We present a SAR model with an underlying MRGP under the bounded regeneration restriction, allowing for multiple GEN timers to be concurrently enabled in each state. This expressivity gain not only supports more accurate fitting of duration distributions from observed statistics, but also enables the definition of mixed rejuvenation strategies combining time-based and inspection-based policies, where the time to the next inspection or rejuvenation depends on the outcomes of diagnostic tests. Experimental results show that replacing GEN timers with Exponential timers with the same mean (to satisfy the enabling restriction) yields inaccurate rejuvenation policies, and that mixed rejuvenation outperforms time-based rejuvenation in maximizing reliability, though at the cost of an acceptable decrease in availability.",TETC,hybrid,非特定的

However, despite the benefits conferred by Cloud-Edge collaborative systems, challenges arise from prolonged operation, rapid evolution, and resource constraints. These challenges may accelerate software aging, resulting in performance degradation, functional disruptions, and increased susceptibility to errors. Software rejuvenation acts as a preemptive and proactive maintenance strategy designed to alleviate the consequences of software aging. Although task migration is a commonly used method for software rejuvenation, addressing software aging in complex Cloud-Edge collaborative systems requires dynamic task migration to adapt to environmental changes. Therefore, to develop a task migration-based rejuvenation strategy with lower latency, energy consumption, and software rejuvenation cost, this paper introduces a method for generating software rejuvenation strategies based on Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Cloud-Edge collaboration systems, named GRCEM. Initially, the environment is modeled to define the state space, action space, and training rewards, meticulously designed to minimize rejuvenation costs for the Cloud-Edge collaborative system. Subsequently, a distributed execution algorithm for deep reinforcement learning is devised, treating each node as an autonomous agent responsible for acquiring knowledge and enhancing rejuvenation strategies through continuous interaction with the system environment. Finally, the rejuvenation strategy is formulated, characterized by its optimal rejuvenation cost. The experimental results demonstrate that the GRCEM method accomplishes software rejuvenation with reduced rejuvenation costs compared to the baseline method.

However, software aging characterization is relatively complicated, and only fitting the variations for a single aging indicator cannot grasp the comprehensive degradation process across different case systems; moreover, since software systems often exhibit long and short-term inherent degradation characteristics, existing prediction models possess a poor ability for modeling both global and local information simultaneously. To tackle the above problems, a novel TTAF prediction framework based on the parallel multi-scale temporal convolution network and transformer (named PMTT) is proposed, by mapping various system running indicators reflecting the software aging to TTAF. PMTT possesses the following distinctive characteristics. First, a local feature extraction module that contains multiple channel TCNs with different scales is developed to extract inherent local information from the raw input. Second, in a parallel manner, a global feature extraction module integrating transformer blocks is built to extract global information representation synchronously using the self-attention mechanism. Afterward, high-level global–local features extracted from different channels are fused, and TTAF is estimated through two fully connected regression layers using the fused features. The proposed PMTT has been compared to seven competitors using run-to-failure data collected from Android and OpenStack systems.

Firstly, the original aging time series data is denoised using discrete wavelet transformation (DWT) and then reconstructed into multi-dimensional data by phase state reconstruction (PSR) to capture potential aging patterns. Subsequently, a deep long short-term memory network (DLSTM) is developed to predict the aging trend.

Secondly, if the system enters an aging state, the Q- Learning algorithm evaluates the value of each rejuvenation operation based on the degree of aging and the cost of rejuvenation operations (such as downtime), ultimately generating the optimal operation. Finally, the experimental results show that, in determining the aging state, the recognition accuracy of the FS-OWA algorithm reached 99.3%, surpassing baseline algorithms by up to 16.52 %. In generating rejuvenation operations, Q-learning algorithm generates a Q-table containing the value of each state-action pair.

However, prolonged high-load operation of Cloud-Edge collaborative system may result in software aging, significantly impacting the reliability of the Cloud-Edge collaborative system, especially in resource-constrained edge environments. Proactive rejuvenation can help restore system robustness, but it comes with costs and affects normal system operation. Determining the appropriate rejuvenation timing and implementing an efficient rejuvenation strategy are crucial. Since the reliability of the edge system is closely related to the stable operation of the entire Cloud-Edge collaborative system, this paper proposes a comprehensive rejuvenation model named SM-OLR. This model calculates the rejuvenation time for the edge system and performs the rejuvenation operation, which is divided into two stages. The first stage involves determining the rejuvenation timing. A Semi-Markov model is used to represent the system state. Specific distribution functions are fitted based on measured values to accurately describe the system's state transitions. This enables a more scientific modeling of the system's state and ensures precise calculation of rejuvenation timing. The second stage focuses on the rejuvenation strategy. In the Cloud-Edge collaborative environment, interactions between edge and cloud, and edge and edge are easily facilitated, making task offloading a highly effective rejuvenation method. The paper adopts task offloading as the rejuvenation strategy. The reinforcement learning algorithm SARSA is employed to dynamically decide the offloading decision for specific tasks.

Each service is thus replicated into a pool of identical replicas. This allows for load distribution among the pool of replicas and a greater degree of fault tolerance compared to a single instance of the service that stands as a single point of failure. The high availability and scalability requirements, coupled with the phenomenon of software aging, have made the replica-based approach pervasive in modern online services. In such configurations, the unavailability of a single replica, due to scheduled maintenance or unexpected failures, does not imply the unavailability of the whole system but rather an increase in the load of the remaining replicas. This identifies a performability problem in which the system can tolerate a certain number of offline replicas in the pool. However, once a certain threshold is exceeded, the resulting high workload pending on the online replicas could degrade the performance of the system, potentially leading to a failure in meeting the non-functional requirements.In this work, we study the problem of aging in a pool of service replicas. We characterize two inspection-based rejuvenation strategies that could be implemented in this context, which we identify as uncoordinated and coordinated rejuvenation. We represent them through the formalism of Stochastic Time Petri Nets (STPN) and through steady-state analysis, we conduct a performability evaluation of both the models as the frequency of inspections and the pool size vary.",ISSREW,model-based,云

Here, the scalability requirement is the average workload response time plus three standard deviations of response time, measured at low load. In addition, we plot, for each experiment sample, the instantaneous available memory and normalized distance of response time from the scalability requirement. We have also parameterized the discrete-time embedded Markov chain with rewards for each experiment, using a discrete representation of the available memory as the Markov chain state variable, and, the normalized distance from the scalability requirement as the state reward. Coloring the states of the Markov chain state transition diagram enabled new insights into the software aging and rejuvenation process, for each strategy, and software rejuvenation granularity level. We conclude by presenting an optimal synthetic resiliency strategy that was derived using Markov decision processes (MDPs).

To limit concurrent component rejuvenations, an efficient calculus is defined to derive the optimal rejuvenation offset of each component, based on the condition of system unavailability expressed as a static fault tree with AND and OR gates. An efficient compositional approach is also provided to derive the system unavailability, by leveraging numerical analysis of a stochastic model with underlying Markov regenerative process. The solution accuracy is exploited to analyze how components loose synchronization over time due to random rejuvenation and repair times, enabling the definition of a macro-rejuvenation policy.

The current standard for recovering a failed unikernel is reboot-based and it involves restarting the whole unikernel-linked application, which leads to service stops and long downtimes. This paper presents VampOS that performs efficient reboot-based recovery of the unikernel layer. VampOS forces the unikernel components to interact with each other in a message-passing manner to restart only the damaged one while keeping the others and the application running.

In practice, software aging prediction has proven to be useful in planning the time to trigger rejuvenation because it provides a prior estimate of future resource consumption. However, aging indicators (e.g., physical memory) in cloud may have the characteristics of long-term slow growth, medium-term seasonality variations (alternating peaks and troughs), and short-term irregular fluctuations. Unfortunately, most of the existing aging prediction methods (e.g., a statistical or single machine learning model) only focus on the accuracy of short-term prediction, while lacking the cognition of the medium and long-term variations of aging indicators and their functions in formulating the rejuvenation schedule (e.g., performing rejuvenation when the load is low can minimize interference to users). To address the above problems, this article proposes a novel hybrid aging prediction framework to work on the prediction of memory resource consumption in cloud by applying a seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on loess (STL) method and Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network, called the decomposition-based GRU (DGRU). The effectiveness of DGRU mainly has two aspects. One is the STL method as a preprocessing technology that can extract the trend, seasonality, and residual characteristics from memory utilization data. The other is that these characteristics can be well predicted separately by a well-designed GRU model, which can model the time-series relationship between the data. Experimental results show that our DGRU framework has superior performance compared with its competitors, including seven single models and six hybrid models. Our study illustrates that the DGRU is a promising solution for high-precision software aging prediction.",TETC,Measurement-based（ML）,虚拟化系统

Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have brought tremendous gains in ARB prediction. However, due to the limited size and extreme class imbalance in ARB datasets, conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs) are susceptible to overfitting, resulting in a suboptimal generalization performance. In this paper, we take advantage of sparse and binary nature of spiking communication in spiking neural networks (SNNs), which inherently provides a brain-inspired regularization to effectively alleviate overfitting. We propose the first spiking convolutional neural network-based ARB prediction model (ARB-SCNN), comprising a spiking encoder followed by a classifier and utilizing the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neuron as the basic spiking computing unit. Considering the spatial-temporal dynamics and the non-differentiability nature, we develop a dedicated training framework for ARB-SCNN, which incorporates the rate coding-based mean square error (MSE) loss and employs the backpropagation through time with the surrogate gradient. Finally, extensive experiments on two real-world ARB datasets demonstrate that our ARB-SCNN effectively mitigates overfitting, improving generalization performance by 7.82% compared to the state-of-the-art DL-based classifiers, and it exhibits up to 5× better computational energy efficiency.",ISSREW,ARB prediction,Linux

ARB prediction helps identify ARBs to prevent software aging. However, early project stages often lack ARB data for model training. To address this, cross-project ARB prediction (CPAP) is proposed, where a model is trained using labeled source projects to predict the ARB present in the target project. In CPAP, distribution discrepancy and class imbalance pose challenges, impacting model performance. In this paper, a hybrid CPAP combines feature transfer learning with class imbalance learning is proposed to solve the above problems, which we named KDK. In the feature transfer learning stage, KDK leverages Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) in conjunction with Double Marginalized Denoising Autoencoders (DMDA) to acquire feature representations that reduce distribution disparities among projects. In the class imbalance learning stage, K-means Clustering Cleaning Ensemble (KCE) is employed to rebalance and clean the source project dataset, who has a severe class imbalance and class overlap. Experiments are conducted on three open-source projects with two performance metrics (AUC and Balance). Experiment results demonstrate that our approach enhances Balance values by 9.0%, 32.9%, 4.4%, and 3.9% in comparison to state-of-the-art CPAP methods, namely TLAP, JPKS, SRLA, and JDA-ISDA, respectively.",ISSREW,ARB prediction,Linux

This phenomenon is primarily attributed to the accumulation of run-time errors, commonly known as aging-related bugs (ARBs). Detecting ARBs through Aging-related Bug Prediction (ARBP) is crucial in ensuring system reliability. The effectiveness of ARBP heavily relies on the quality of datasets. However, ARB datasets often suffer from class overlap, where instances from different classes exhibit similar feature values. Class overlap poses a significant challenge as it compromises the quality of training data and subsequently impacts ARBP accuracy. To address this issue, we propose an improved Fuzzy C-means clustering method named IFCM, designed to mitigate class overlap in ARBP tasks. IFCM can identify whether an instance occurs overlap, and identify the overlap degree of this instance through the predefined parameters. We evaluate our proposed method on two public datasets Linux and MySQL and one self-collected dataset NetBSD using five different classifiers with five performance metrics (AUC, F1, Balance, PD, PF). Comparison with four existing methods (No clean, NCL, IKMCCA, ROCT) demonstrates that IFCM is effective in alleviating class overlap in ARBP.

Thus, we propose thread- and interface-level metrics to portray aging at a finer granularity and conduct an empirical study to reidentify classic and new software aging metrics in Android. Analysis confirms that software aging in Android is less reflected in global resources metrics but in more fine-grained ones, so thread- and interface-level metrics combined with specific classic resource and process-level metrics are helpful as indicators of software aging. These metrics have been confirmed and deployed for aging monitoring by our mobile phone manufacturer collaborators.

The technique is engineered in two phases. Before releasing the (customized) Android version, a heap profiling facility is used by the manufacturer’s developers to identify potentially bloating data structures in Android services and to instrument their code. After release, an aging detection and rejuvenation service will safely clean up the bloating data structures, with a negligible impact on user perception and device availability, as neither the device nor operating system’s processes are restarted.

Fault injection is an effective methodology for validating components that are supposed to detect the malfunctions and report/correct them. This paper studies the effectiveness of Kubernetes in dealing with faults and aging in microservices, and on the possibility of using faults to accelerate aging effects for testing purposes. For this, we conducted an analysis of the implementation and tuning of Kubernetes probes, followed by experiments with varying load and fault injection into two distinct and representative microservice testbeds to analyze the capacity of probes in detecting issues in applications. The goal is to improve the knowledge of researchers and developers on whether Kubernetes can detect different faults and aging issues. Also, even though some services tend to accumulate aging effects, with increasing resource consumption, Kubernetes does not detect them nor acts on them, indicating that probes may be insufficient for aging scenarios.

The use of multiple concurrent GEN timers allows more accurate fitting of duration distributions from observed statistics (e.g., mean and variance), as well as better model expressiveness, enabling the formulation of mixed rejuvenation strategies that combine time-triggered and event-triggered rejuvenation. We leverage the functions for regenerative analysis based on stochastic state classes of the ORIS tool (through its SIRIO library) to evaluate this class of models and to select the rejuvenation period achieving an optimal tradeoff between two steady-state metrics, availability and undetected failure probability. We also show that, when G EN timers are replaced by exponential timers with the same mean (to satisfy enabling restriction), transient and steady-state are affected, resulting in inaccurate rejuvenation policies.",ISSREW,Model-based,非特定的

However, continuous image processing on a drone may entail the degradation of performance and reliability over the long-time operation, also known as software aging. Since the degradation due to software aging progresses with the amount of the workload to process, offloading the image processing tasks to other computers can mitigate the progression of the software aging. In this paper, we propose a new software life-extension method to counteract software aging on a drone image processing system by means of proactive task offloading. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we develop continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) to analyze the stochastic behaviors of the system. Through numerical experiments, we show that proactive offloading improves the steady-state availability, the mean time to down (MTTD), and the average throughput by 1.85%, 1.57x, 1.48x, respectively.

Its occurrence will lead to poor responsiveness or crash/hang failure of the system. Recently, the strategies to schedule rejuvenation are marching toward a situation that needs to consider both usage behavioral aspects of its users (i.e., switch between active and sleep modes) and two-level software aging process (i.e., Operating System (OS) and Application Software (AS)), because rejuvenating the OS or AS during active time slot contributes to terrible user experience. To be able to achieve higher user experience and lower user interference, in this paper, we present to employ the Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) model to study the impact of software aging and rejuvenation on user experience on two different rejuvenation strategies: condition-based and time-based rejuvenations. In contrast to the existing works, our models capture the interactions between usage behavioral aspects of users and two-level aging and rejuvenation. We then define three metrics to evaluate the user experience, including User-perceived (1) Fluency (UF), (2) Failure Probability (UFP), and (3) Availability (UA). The numerical analysis has the following noticed conclusions. The optimal value of UF yielded by condition-based rejuvenation reaches a 3.486% improvement over that of time-based. Therefore, the former is an appealing rejuvenation solution. Moreover, compared with single-level (OS and AS) rejuvenation models, two-level rejuvenation indeed improves the user experience.

Imbalanced dataset, where the representation of ARBs patterns is very less as compared to the representation of the non-ARBs pattern significantly hinders the performance of the ARBs prediction models. Therefore, in this article, we present an oversampling approach, generative adversarial networks-based synthetic data generation-based ARBs prediction models. The approach uses generative adversarial networks to generate synthetic samples for the ARBs patterns in the given datasets implicitly and build the prediction models on the processed datasets. To validate the performance of the presented approach, we perform an experimental study for the seven ARBs datasets collected from the public repository and use various performance measures to evaluate the results.

Exploiting these advantages requires new and specialized designs for management, automation, and orchestration systems which are capable of reliably operating and handling new elements such as virtual functions, virtualized infrastructures, and a whole new set of relationships among them. Operations such as resource allocation, instantiation, monitoring, scaling, or termination of virtual functions are key lifecycle operations that NFV management and orchestration (NFV-MANO) frameworks need to correctly perform. Failures of the NFV-MANO prevent the network ability to respond to new service requests or events related to the normal lifecycle operation of network services. Thus, it is important to ensure robustness and high availability of the MANO framework. This paper adopts a model-driven approach to predict the availability of the NFV-MANO and assess the impact that different failure modes have. We propose different models, based on Stochastic Activity Networks (SANs), which abstract various MANO deployment configurations, inspired by current containerized open-source MANO implementations. Moreover, we integrate software rejuvenation and investigate the trade-off between its associated overhead and system availability increase. An extensive experimental campaign with fault-injection techniques on a real-life MANO implementation allows to derive a number of realistic recovery parameters. The case studies are used to quantitatively evaluate the steady-state availability and identify the most important parameters influencing system availability for the different deployment configurations.",TNSM,model-based,SDN

In Software Defined Networking (SDN), for instance, the control plane functions of forwarding devices are outsourced to the controller. Softwarized network components are expected to provide uninterrupted service during long periods of time, which makes them prone to the effects of software aging, a phenomena that has been observed in operational software systems where the failure rate increases or the performance of the software degrades with the elapsed time since the last restart. The effects of software aging in operational networks are typically mitigated by software rejuvenation, i.e., planned restarts cleaning the internal system state in order to prevent or postpone aging-related failures. This article presents ARES, a three-step methodological framework for the management of the effects of software aging in softwarized networks, applied to the case study of open source SDN orchestration platforms. Using ARES, we demonstrate that software aging is a systematic problem that cannot be neglected in network orchestration systems. It stems not only from aging-related bugs and natural aging due to fragmentation, but also from design choices, e.g., when implementing distributed systems. Measurements for Open Network Operating System (ONOS) and OpenDaylight (ODL) demonstrate how “simple” and common networking tasks let network performance degrade rapidly and even lead to crashes: for instance, adding and removing 300 intents per second in ONOS significantly increases the response time by 50% per day and depletes the memory at the rate of 18GB per day. Moreover, we demonstrate a first rejuvenation approach that can mitigate the effects of aging in ONOS.",TNSM,Measurement-based（阈值）,SDN

Failures in the software development process may impact these attributes. Flawed code and overall software misdesign may cause internal errors, leading to system malfunction. Some errors might be identified and fixed during the software testing process. However, other errors may manifest only during the production stage. This is the case of the software aging phenomenon, which is related to the progressive degradation that a software performance or reliability suffers during its operational life. This paper proposes a methodology for software maintenance that is tailored to identify, correct, and mitigate the software aging effects. If the source code can be modified and a new version deployed with minimal impact, thus data from aging detection is used for corrective maintenance, i.e., for fixing the bug that causes the aging effects. If the software cannot be fixed nor its version updated without long system interruption or other bad consequences, then our approach can mitigate the aging effects, in a preventive maintenance to avoid service outages. The proposed methodology is validated through both Stochastic Petri Net (SPN) models and experiments in a controlled environment. The model evaluation considering a hybrid maintenance routine (preventive and corrective) yielded an availability of 99.82%, representing an annual downtime of 15.9 hours. By contrast, the baseline scenario containing only reactive maintenance (i.e., repairing only after failure) had more than 1342 hours of annual downtime- 80 times higher than the proposed approach.",SysCon,Model-based,非特定的

In practice, the labeled data are rare in many cases. In addition, it is difficult to label all samples manually. Furthermore, there is a serious class imbalance problem in ARBs datasets. In order to address the two problems, we propose a framework named QUIRE-HUE.

On the other hand, we apply a Hashing-Based Undersampling Ensemble (HUE) by constructing diversified training subspaces for undersampling to alleviate class imbalance problem. A set of experiments are performed on two large open-source projects (MySQL, Linux) with six different machine learning classifiers. We use Balance and AUC as the evaluation metrics.

Applications running on cloud computing can also suffer from such memory degradation that may cause severe performance degradation or even experience a system failure. Therefore, it is essential to monitor such degradation trends and find the potential causes to provide reliable application services on cloud computing. In this paper, we consider both private and public cloud environments for deploying an image classification system and experimentally investigate the memory degradation that appeared in these environments. The degradation trends in the available memory statistics are confirmed by the Mann-Kendall test in both cloud environments. We apply causal structure discovery methods to process-level memory statistics to identify the causality of the observed memory degradations. Our analytical results identify the suspicious processes potentially leading to memory degradations in public and private cloud environments.",ISSREW,度量,云环境图像分类

In this way, different scopes configurations implicitly act as different software micro-rejuvenation policies, emphasising the importance of choices in the assignment of component scopes; while supporting the stateful behaviour in data-retention mechanism, wider scopes may majorly expose inmemory components to software aging processes. We report a practical experience illustrating how the memory maintained in the business logic of a Web Application may give space to aging processes affecting the runtime behaviour of a stateful web application, and we show how this threat is contrasted by micro-rejuvenation at component level implemented by the container under different assignment strategies for components scopes. To this end, we propose an accelerated testing approach relying on a fault injection process that executes an event-driven simulation of arising soft errors over time. Experimentation on an exemplary web application implemented on the stack of Java Enterprise Edition show how manifestation, correction, and propagation of errors are conditioned by different scopes assigned to components by the software developer.",ISSREW,testing,服务器

In this work, we propose a method for unfolding aging and rejuvenation models into their sequential counterparts to enable the computation of transient state probabilities in the proposed models. We have applied our methodology to one specific security attack scenario and four large campus micro-grids case studies.

We were able to analytically evaluate the transient failure probability and the associated Instantaneous Expected Energy Not Supplied metric, for each of the four case studies, from one specific attack. We envision several practical applications of the proposed methodology. First, because the micro-grid model is solved analytically, the approach can be used to support micro-grid engineering optimizations accounting for security intrusions. Second, micro-grid engineers could use the approach to detect security attacks by monitoring for unexpected deviations of the Energy Not Supplied metric.",ISSREW,Model-based,智能电网

Because of the low presence and reproducing difficulty of ARBs, collecting enough training data to predict ARBs in a project is not easy. Thus, cross-project ARB prediction has been proposed. There are two main challenges in cross-project ARB prediction, namely distribution differences and severe class imbalance. As for the first challenge, existing cross-project ARB prediction approaches only focus on the transferability between domains while ignoring the discriminability between classes. As for the second challenge, existing approaches only consider the imbalance between the classes while ignoring the within-class imbalance problem. To solve these problems, a cross-project ARB prediction approach based on Joint Probability Domain Adaptation (JPDA) and k- means SMOTE (KS), called JPKS, is proposed. JPDA is used to consider the transferability and discriminability simultaneously, and KS solves the within-class and between-class imbalance problems. Experiments are conducted on two natural software systems to verify the performance of JPKS. The results show that JPKS can improve the performance of ARB prediction.",QRS-C,ARB prediction,Linux

It refers to the increase of failure rates or the decline of performance in a long-running software system, mainly caused by Aging-Related Bugs (ARBs). Failure incurred by software aging may cause economic loss and may lead to casualties in security-critical systems. Automatic classification of ARB reports is an effective method to ensure the software system's quality by helping us detect and fix the bugs in software systems. There are two challenges in the automatic classification of ARB reports at present. Firstly, it is difficult to distinguish the ARB reports since the semantics of the text is ambiguous and hard to be recognized; secondly, the number of ARB reports is much smaller than other types of bugs, which may lead to class imbalance. Therefore, An ARB Report Automatic Classification Method based on BERT(ARB-BERT) is proposed in this paper to alleviate these problems. We combined back-translation, random under-sampling and random over-sampling to reduce the class imbalance problem in classification. By considering the ARB reports' characteristics, we utilize BERT as the semantic model, extracting feature vectors containing more accurate and sufficient information. The experimental results show that our method can improve the accuracy, precision, F-measure, and recall value compared with previous methods.",DSA,Classification,Linux

Containers rely on a set of technologies different from the features that enable hardware virtualization (i.e., hypervisor-based virtual machines). However, both types of virtualized environments are employed to host applications that will be accessible anytime, anywhere. Thus, they are prone to software aging, which usually affects systems that run for long time intervals. Researchers have identified software aging effects in distinct types of cloud computing environments and hypervisors over recent years. However, a few works have dealt with this phenomenon in container-based platforms. This paper presents an experimental analysis of the software aging effects observed on Docker platforms while also evaluating a time- series model's fitness to predict resource consumption's progress caused by software aging. We employ a stress test workload tailored for the scenario of containers arranged in a cluster managed by Docker Swarm. The obtained results indicate an increasing usage of resident memory, virtual memory, and CPU usage, as the system undergoes subsequent scale-up and scale-down operations. The quadratic trend model was the best fitting approach for predicting resident and virtual memory usage, with less than 5% of prediction error.

To mitigate the aging effects and prevent serious losses caused by the system failure, software rejuvenations can be proactively performed to restore the system performance. This paper models and optimizes a state-based rejuvenation policy for software systems performing real-time computing tasks and undergoing periodic inspections. During each scheduled inspection, the system state is evaluated and the decision about the rejuvenation is made based on the evaluated system state and a rejuvenation decision function. The time of each rejuvenation procedure (corresponding to the system downtime) depends on the system state as well as on the amount of task operations accomplished before deciding to perform the rejuvenation. As the rejuvenation policy determines the time and number of rejuvenations performed during the task processing, it can affect the probability that the system can accomplish the real-time task by a certain deadline significantly. In this work, we optimize the state-based rejuvenation policy to maximize the probability of task completion (PTC) of periodically inspected software systems. The methodology encompasses an event transition-based iterative method proposed for quantifying the PTC and application of the Genetic Algorithm for deriving the optimal rejuvenation policy. Examples are presented to demonstrate the proposed methodology and influences of several parameters (e.g., inspection interval, rejuvenation time) on the optimization results.",RESS,model-based,非特定的

We derive the optimal state-based rejuvenation policy minimizing the total expected mission cost for software aging systems subject to multiple performance degradation states. The solution encompasses an event transition-based numerical method that assesses the total expected mission cost of a real-time task, covering penalty cost from the mission failure, operation cost of running the mission software and the expected rejuvenation cost. The proposed cost evaluation model can accommodate arbitrary types of state transition time distributions.

It works by proactively terminating the system, cleaning the internal state of the system, and restarting the system. Since rejuvenation incurs extra system overhead and downtime cost, it is important to determine the optimal time to trigger rejuvenation. This paper proposes a two-layer model to characterize the system failure behavior and rejuvenation process under aging condition, planning a time-based rejuvenation policy maximizing the system availability and minimizing downtime cost. The lower layer is a failure model that uses an analytical model and runtime measurements to build the failure distribution of the aging system. The upper layer is a rejuvenation model that takes the failure distribution from the lower layer as input to formulate the availability function and downtime cost function. Taking these two functions as optimization targets, we can obtain the optimal rejuvenation time. Compared with the traditional analytical model, the two-layer model modeling software failure considers runtime measurements, which can describe the aging behavior more accurately. In the experimental part, we comprehensively evaluate the two-layer model by studying the aging of the web search system.

Docker is a widespread platform for the creation and management of containers. As in any computational cloud service, Docker environments must deal with the intensive workload and may have a long-term life cycle, which might trigger some problems that compromise the system dependability. The software aging phenomenon is one of these likely problems. It is a process of cumulative errors or system misbehavior that leads to application failures and performance degradation throughout its runtime. This paper aims to monitor and evaluate software aging effects on the Docker platform in a cloud computing environment. We conducted two experimental studies with automated workloads to simulate containers' life cycle and the intensive use of Docker features, while the system was monitored.

Unplanned downtime is mostly caused by software failure due to software aging rather than hardware failure. The aging related faults have a huge effect on the availability for software components, SDN controllers. For that reason, the work presented in this paper offers the availability model for software aging of SDN controllers by applying software rejuvenation.

Secondly, according to the time series dataset, BEGAN based generation method will fit the user's usage habits and generate the dataset which has software aging characteristics. At last, we use the generative dataset to train a K-Means clustering model. With the trained model, we can precisely determine whether the current Android system enters into the aging state or remains in the normal state. In order to validate the effectiveness of the GAN-ASD, we use two evaluation criterion in our comparison experiment.

To counteract the aging effect, software rejuvenation is widely implemented to restore the performance of a degraded system before the system crash actually takes place. To facilitate an effective system function restoration after each rejuvenation action, it is desirable to apply checkpointing to occasionally save the system state on a reliable storage so that the mission task can be resumed from the last saved checkpoint (instead of being restarted from the very beginning). As both rejuvenation and checkpointing procedures incur system overhead while bringing these benefits, it is significant to determine the optimal rejuvenation and checkpointing scheduling policy optimizing the system performance measures of interest. This paper makes new contributions by modeling and optimizing the joint maintenance policy involving state-based rejuvenation and periodic checkpointing schedule for software systems performing real-time computing tasks. The system can undergo multiple performance degradation levels or states, and transition time between different states can assume arbitrary types of distributions. The proposed solution methodology encompasses an efficient numerical algorithm for evaluating the probability of task completion (PTC) by a pre-specified deadline. The joint optimal rejuvenation and checkpointing policy is further determined to maximize the PTC of the considered real-time task.

This phenomenon has been named software aging, which is caused by aging-related bugs (ARBs). Testing resource allocation can be optimized by identifying ARB-prone modules with ARB prediction. However, due to the low presence and reproducing difficulty of ARBs, it is usually hard to collect sufficient training data to carry out within-project ARB prediction. In this paper, we propose an approach named transfer learning based aging-related bug prediction (TLAP) to perform cross-project ARB prediction. TLAP first takes advantage of transfer learning to reduce distribution difference between training and testing project. Then, class imbalance learning is conducted to mitigate the severe class imbalance between ARB-prone and ARB-free modules. Finally, machine learning methods are used to handle bug prediction tasks. The effectiveness of this approach is validated and evaluated by nine groups of experiments on real software systems. Major conclusions from the experiments include the following: first, TLAP improves cross-project ARB prediction on average compared with traditional machine learning methods; second, utilizing information from multiple-projects can further improve the prediction performance on average. In the best case, it outperforms within-project prediction; third, the number of ARB-prone files and distribution similarity can influence TLAP performance.",TR,PRE,Linux、MySQL、AXIS、HTTPD

The consequence of software aging should be significant, whereas such a risk has not been studied in the previous literature. In this paper, we propose a deterministic and stochastic Petri Net (DSPN) to quantitatively analyze the impacts of software aging phenomenon on a cyber-physical system using edge computing. As a data analytic application using real-world sensor data, we consider anomaly detection for a water treatment plant. We introduce two application-oriented performance measures, namely detection loss probability and the expected number of false alarms in terms of plant anomaly detection. Our numerical and simulation experiments on the proposed DSPN show that software aging clearly has negative impacts on the defined performance measures that reveal the necessity of greater attention to software aging issues in edge computing systems.",ISSREW,Model-based,CPS

In the research field of software aging and rejuvenation for cloud services, how to accurately predict the cloud resource consumption in the aging software system for determining suitable time to perform rejuvenation is a significant and indispensable issue.

ARB prediction can help developers discover and remove ARBs, thus alleviating the impact of software aging. However, ARB-prone files occupy a small percentage of all the analyzed files. It is usually difficult to gather sufficient ARB data within a project. To overcome the limited availability of training data, several researchers have recently developed cross-project models for ARB prediction. A key point for cross-project models is to learn a good representation for instances in different projects. Nevertheless, most of the previous approaches neither consider the reconstruction property of new representation nor encode source samples' label information in learning representation. To address these shortcomings, we propose a Supervised Representation Learning Approach (SRLA), which is based on double encoding-layer autoencoder, to perform cross-project ARB prediction. Moreover, we present a transfer cross-validation framework to select the hyper-parameters of cross-project models.

Experimental results reveal that the random under-sampling approach performs best followed by RUSBoost in-terms of the mean AUC metric. Statistical significance test demonstrates that there is a significant difference between the performance of the various feature selection techniques.

However, the practical effect of prior approaches are far from satisfactory due to lack of effective aging indicators and difficult to set accurate threshold. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach, which combines model and measurements to construct a probabilistic aging indicator.

To overcome this problem, we propose an automatic forecasting strategy to support the system administrators to choose the best moment to perform software rejuvenation. Our strategy uses six time series techniques: Drift, Simple Exponential Smoothing, Holt, Holt-Winters, Linear Regression, and ARIMA. In our proposal, the most suitable one is chosen automatically as the best fit for a particular scenario. Three case studies were performed to evaluate the efficiency of our automatic strategy. Our proposal aims to increase the system's availability while decreasing the QoS violation probability. In one of our experiments, we can observe a reduction of 92.3% in the system's downtime.

The normal system performance can be recovered by software rejuvenation, which restarts the software system to clear all the internal error states due to software aging. Since software rejuvenation drops all the jobs in the system, a trigger for software rejuvenation needs to be carefully determined in consideration of such costs. In this paper, we theoretically derive the optimal policy that minimizes the cost of decision for software rejuvenation in a deteriorating job processing system, which is modeled as an M/M/1 queue with infinite buffer size. In our model, the number of queued jobs is used to represent the system state and the decision of rejuvenation is made upon the completion of a foreground job. We formulate the problem as an optimal stopping problem to analytically derive the optimal policy for the rejuvenation decision. The analytical results show that the optimal stopping policy is determined by the service degradation rate, the costs of dropped jobs and delayed jobs, and it does not depend on the number of queued jobs.

Software rejuvenation refreshes the running states of an application by restarting it. This method faces a challenge to apply it to a new type of applications, in-memory databases (DBs). Compared to stateless applications such as web servers, rejuvenating in-memory DBs is significantly expensive. Since inmemory DBs typically allocate a large amount of memory and manage numerous running states such as DB block caches and key-value pairs in their own memory regions, their rejuvenation involves the loss of running states preserved in memory regions, resulting in causing severe performance overhead. This paper presents Rejuvemcached, which allows us to perform efficient software rejuvenation with lower performance overhead. Our key insight is to decouple data content objects from memory objects; Rejuvemcached treats its key-value items as data content objects. During the rejuvenation, Rejuvemcached preserves them and rebuilds the other memory objects that are a major source of software aging.

At the same time, different workloads on Android have different aging phenomena, which may influence the validation of system state. Based on these, we carried out experiments to simulate user behavior on Android and find software aging phenomena in Android. Then we used active learning based on random forest and four states to build model and constructed software aging rejuvenation strategy on Android. Comparing the experiments without rejuvenation, there is an obvious decrease of the average of application launch time after using the rejuvenation strategy, and the running time of experiments with rejuvenation is longer than that without rejuvenation, which improves the user experience and reduces the probability of unexpected errors.",ISSREW,Measurement-based（ML）,Android

The phenomenon of software aging is that the performance of the software system is degradation in a long-running state, which is the result of exhaustion of system resources, the accumulation of internal error conditions and so on. In order to counteract software aging, a technique, which called software rejuvenation, has been proposed, this procedure involves occasionally stopping a system process, cleaning its running environment and restarting it. Due to the direct and indirect costs incurred by software rejuvenation, when to carry out this action is very important. Traditionally, most scholars focused on time series or analytic methods to model software aging process, however, machine learning algorithm has been neglected. In this paper, we make a detailed analysis and predict about the web server parameters by multiple linear regression algorithm. Firstly, the aging phenomenon of the system is simulated by the pressure testing tool and then collecting data and preprocessed. Secondly, we fit time series models to the data collected and determine the trend of resource consumption.

The loss caused by software aging can be reduced through proper rejuvenation strategies, the key to which is to determine the rejuvenation thresholds. Essence of some traditional methods is to set predetermined thresholds based on empirical data. However, in some systems where the memory is shared between operating system and application software (two-granularity software system), as the memory consumption is closely related to system performance and changes constantly, using empirical thresholds may cause system outage or waste of resources. In this paper, an adaptive strategy is adopted to optimize the thresholds. Instead of fixed thresholds, the method regularly regulates the thresholds by taking feedback information in the running process into account. Especially, critical equations are constructed to calculate the thresholds by maximizing the system availability. Simulation results show that the proposed method achieves higher availability and more stable performance than that based on empirical thresholds.",PRDC,measurement-based,非特定的

We believe studying aberrant aging can contribute to better understanding of software aging in real world. The mechanism utilizes random sliding windows over LOF (Local Outlier Factor) algorithm to analyze the CPU and workload indicators, which displays good accuracy and recall rate in a real world application. Moreover, we analyze how the software trend to age aberrantly and verify if aberrant aging also obeys the rules in controlled experiment.

In this paper, a two-granularity inspection-based software rejuvenation policy, which works as a closed-loop control technique, is proposed. This policy mitigates the negative impact of two-level software aging. The two levels considered are the user-level applications and the operating system. A Markov regenerative process model is constructed based on the system condition. We obtain the degradation rate of the application software and operating system from fault injection experiments. The diagnostic accuracy of the adopted monitor and analysis system, which is applied to inspect the application software and operating system, is considered as we provide the optimal rejuvenation strategies. Finally, the availability and the overall loss probability with their corresponding optimal inspection time intervals are obtained numerically based on the parameter values estimated from the experiments. Experimental results show that two-granularity software rejuvenation is much more effective than traditional single-level software rejuvenation. In our experimental study, when two-granularity software rejuvenation is used, the unavailability and the overall loss probability of the system were reduced by 17.9% and 2.65%, respectively, in comparison with the single-level rejuvenation.",TR,Model-based; rej,软件系统

These chronic problems often fly under the radar of software monitoring systems before causing severe impacts (e.g., system failures). Therefore, it is a challenging issue how to timely predict the occurrence of failures caused by these problems. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of prior approaches are far from satisfactory due to the insufficiency of aging indicators adopted by them. To accurately predict failures caused by software aging which are named as Aging-Related Failure (ARFs), this paper presents a novel entropy-based aging indicator, namely Multidimensional Multi-scale Entropy (MMSE) which leverages the complexity embedded in runtime performance metrics to indicate software aging. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to leverage entropy to predict ARFs. Based upon MMSE, we implement three failure prediction approaches encapsulated in a proof-of-concept prototype named ARF-Predictor. The experimental evaluations in a Video on Demand (VoD) system, and in a real-world production system, AntVision, show that ARF-Predictor can predict ARFs with a very high accuracy and a low Ahead-Time-To-Failure (ATTF). Compared to previous approaches, ARF-Predictor improves the prediction accuracy by about 5 times and reduces ATTF even by 3 orders of magnitude. In addition, ARF-Predictor is light-weight enough to satisfy the real-time requirement.",TDSC,度量,视频点播系统与真实世界生产系统

Firstly, we collected data from a running commercial web server and preprocessed these data. Secondly, feature selection algorithm was applied to find a subset of model parameters set. Thirdly, time series model was used to predict values of selected parameters in advance. Fourthly, some machine learning algorithms were used to model software aging process and to predict software aging. Fifthly, we used sensitivity analysis to analyze how heavily outcomes changed following input variables change. In the last, we applied our method to an IIS web server.

In order to provide a more accurate reference for the software rejuvenation, the key parameters of the software running process are established by using the non-stationary time series. An experimental platform, which is based on the current popular Apache server software, is presented.

Then, we carry out mathematical modeling of aging and predictive analysis with Markov chains. Through our experiments and modeling analysis, we observe the existence of Android aging, and find that aging is generally irreversible and that the warm rejuvenation (application restart) has little effect on the recovery or mitigation of aging problem.

A cluster system is a kind of software load-sharing system (LSS) whose reliability is significantly dependent on system software. Therefore, traditional reliability analysis methods for hardware LSSs are not applicable for cluster systems. In this paper, we develop a reliability analysis model for redundant cluster systems consisting of initial servers and cold standby servers used to replace failed ones. System reliability process is modeled with a state-based non-homogeneous Markov process (NHMH), where each state corresponds to a non-homogeneous Poisson processe (NHPP). NHPP arrival rate is expressed using Cox's proportional hazard model (PHM) in terms of cumulative and instantaneous workload of system software.

These service-oriented applications often operate continuously, which exposes the software to ""aging"" where resource deterioration such as memory leaks can lead resource exhaustion and ultimately system failure. To mitigate the impact of aging, software rejuvenation refreshes or restarts the system periodically to recover lost resources, thereby averting failures. Software rejuvenation may also employ fault tolerance to reduce the impact of individual failures on system availability. However, virtually all previous software rejuvenation studies assume that failures experienced by the individual servers comprising a fault tolerant system are statistically independent. This paper analyzes the impact of correlated failures on the optimality of rejuvenation schedules for a system composed of two parallel servers that can experience correlated failures. The examples illustrate the impact of correlation on the optimality of rejuvenation schedules to maximize availability and minimize down time cost. The results indicate that increasing the correlation between the failures of the servers increases the rejuvenation period when the objective is to maximize availability. However, the rejuvenation period decreases when the objective is to minimize down time cost. Thus, the proposed approach can objectively identify the optimal rejuvenation period that maximizes availability or minimizes down time cost.",RAMS,Model-based,服务器

Software aging is restored by a technique called software rejuvenation, e.g., a system reboot. To reduce the downtime due to software rejuvenation, all the virtual machines (VMs) on an aged virtualized system have to be migrated in advance. However, VM migration stresses the system and causes performance degradation. In this paper, we propose VMBeam, which enables lightweight software rejuvenation of virtualized systems using zero-copy migration. When rejuvenating an aged virtualized system, VMBeam starts a new virtualized system at the same host by using nested virtualization. Then it migrates all the VMs from the aged virtualized system to the clean one. At this time, VMBeam directly relocates the memory of the VMs on the aged virtualized system to the clean virtualized system without any copy. We have implemented VMBeam in Xen and confirmed the decreases of system loads.",APSYS,rej,虚拟化系统

Software rejuvenation is a proactive technique which leads to removing the accumulated software errors by stopping the system, cleaning up its internal state, and resuming its normal operation. One of the main challenges of software rejuvenation is accurately predicting the time to crash due to aging factors such as memory leaks.

Through partitioning the execution between the device side and the cloud side, the mobile device can have the most benefit from offloading in reducing utilisation of the device and increasing its lifetime. In this paper, we propose a path-based offloading partitioning (POP) algorithm to determine which portions of the application tasks to run on mobile devices and which portions on cloud servers with different cost models in mobile environments.

Nevertheless, we pinpoint some drawbacks of MKSK in this paper: 1) MKSK cannot be automated for large scale software degradation analysis, 2) MKSK estimates the degradation trend of software in an oversimplified linear way, 3) MKSK is sensitive to noise, and 4) MKSK suffers from high computational complexity. To overcome all these limitations, we propose a more advanced approach called Modified Cox-Stuart Test & Iterative Hodrick-Prescott Filter (CSHP).

We compare the performance of the DBRA with the one of the static rejuvenation algorithm with averaging (SRAA) presented by Avritzer et al.

We found problems that may be harmful to system dependability and performance, specifically regarding to RAM memory and swap space exhaustion, besides highly excessive CPU utilization by the virtual machines.

Using a semi-Markov process (SMP) to model the server behavior, the steady-state server availability is computed and the theory developed in Kulkarni et al.

There are various software rejuvenation approaches existing in literature that can be broadly categorized into two categories namely model based approaches and measurement based approaches. Time to failure is predicted in measurement based approaches by monitoring the resource usage statistics. There can be any non-linear relationship between resource usage statistics and the time to failure. Such a nonlinear function can be approximated using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The change in the value of attributes of resources is given as input to ANN and new value of time to failure is generated as output.

The motivation of our formulated model is that the relationship between the service provider and the service maintainer is collaborative as well as having different goals between them, the service provider as a leader wants to maximize his system availability, while the service maintainer wants to minimize his maintenance cost. Thus, the problem of maximizing availability and minimizing cost between the service provider and service maintainer is Stackelberg game based. Next, we assume that the AS degradation is caused by resource consumption due to memory leaks for the AS on the active VMs, and we present the system degradation states based on Markov renewal processes. We give the analytical definitions of threshold levels for Ralert at each VM, which are used to determine the optimal rejuvenation schedules. In addition, we obtain the steady-state availability expressions for the system and the mean maintenance cost. Finally, we give the Stackelberg strategy with the open-loop information and the solutions for the game theory by a numerical illustration.",ISSREW,Model-based,服务器

For identifying the cause of performance deterioration, we analyse the impact of server and network. It is well known that software aging is a common phenomenon in computer systems, which may cause frequent software faults and finally result in system outage. As rejuvenation is used to counteract software aging, through our experiment, we observed the impact of periodical rejuvenation on the offloading system. Although the rejuvenation process impairs the system performance temporarily, long-term stability of the server is guaranteed.

In the second step, an artificial neural network model is developed to model the residuals from ARIMA model. The results show that the proposed hybrid model can be a good trade-off to forecast resource consumption.",ISSREW,measurement-based,web服务器

We propose a systematic approach to detect software aging which has in a shorter test time and higher accuracy compared to traditional aging detection via stress testing and trend detection with high confidence. The approach is based on a comparative differential analysis where a software version under test is compared with against a previous robust version by observing in terms of behavioral (signal) changes during system tests of resource metrics. A key instrument adopted is a divergence chart, which expresses time-dependent differences between two signals, allowing us to detect changes in the system metrics' values which indicate the existence of software aging. In our experimental study, we focuses on memory-leak detection and the and evaluates divergence charts are computed using various multiple statistical techniques combined paired with different application-level memory related metrics (RSS and Heap Usage).

Software rejuvenation is a promising technique for improving the availability of server virtualized systems as it can postpone or prevent failures caused by software aging in both the VM and the underlying virtual machine monitor (VMM). In this paper, we study the effectiveness of a combination of VMM rejuvenation and live VM migration. When a VMM needs to be rejuvenated, the hosted VMs running on the VMM can be moved to another host using live VM migration and continue the execution even during the VMM rejuvenation. We call this technique Migrate-VM rejuvenation and construct an availability model in the stochastic reward net for evaluating it in comparison with the conventional approaches; Cold-VM rejuvenation and Warm-VM rejuvenation. The designed model enables us to find the optimum combinations of rejuvenation trigger intervals that maximize the availability of VM. In terms of the maximum VM availability, Migrate-VM rejuvenation is potentially the best approach. However, the advantage of Migrate-VM rejuvenation depends on the type of live VM migration (stop-and-copy or pre-copy) and the policy for migration back to the original host after VMM rejuvenation (return-back or stay-on). Through numerical examples, we show that “pre-copy” live VM migration is encouraged rather than pure “stop-and-copy” migration and it is better to return back VM to the original host soon after the VMM rejuvenation (i.e., “return-back” rather than “stay-on” policy) for high-availability. The effect of the VMM rejuvenation technique on the expected number of transactions lost is also studied by combining the availability model with an M/M/1/n queueing model.",PEVA,Model-based; rej,服务器

This phenomenon is referred to as software aging, and it may eventually lead to an unacceptable level of system performance degradation and/or crash failure. A technique called software rejuvenation can be used to counteract software aging. This technique involves occasionally terminating an application or a system, cleaning its internal state and/or its environment, and restarting it. By removing the accrued error conditions and freeing up or defragmenting operating system resources, this technique proactively prevents unexpected future system outages. Unlike downtime caused by sudden failure occurrences, the downtime related to software rejuvenation can be scheduled at the discretion of the user or administrator, typically during the middle of the night or over weekends. This paper presents a generalized condition-based software rejuvenation model that is applicable to a wide range of applications. The rejuvenation model includes a stochastic deterioration process, a set of rejuvenation actions and their effects, and a schedule inspection policy that identifies the system deterioration. The optimal rejuvenation policy that minimizes the overall cost associated with the system is obtained using Markov decision processes. With minor modifications, the model can also be used for maximizing the system availability/capacity.

Computer operating systems play an important role in IT systems availability. Due to the complexity of their architecture, they are prone to suffer failures due to several types of software faults. Software aging causes a nonnegligible fraction of these failures. It leads to an accumulation of errors with time, increasing the system failure rate. This phenomenon can be accompanied by performance degradation and eventually system hang or even crash. As a countermeasure, software rejuvenation entails stopping the system, cleaning its internal state, and resuming its operation. This process usually incurs downtime. For an operating system, the downtime impacts any application running on top of it. Several solutions have been developed to speed up the boot time of operating systems in order to reduce the downtime overhead. We present a study of two fast OS reboot techniques for rejuvenation of Linux-based operating systems, namely Kexec and Phase-based reboot. The study measures the performance penalty they introduce and the gain in reduction of downtime overhead. The results reveal that the Kexec and Phase-based reboot have no statistically significant impact in terms of performance penalty from the user perspective. However, they may require extra resource (e.g., CPU) usage. The downtime overhead reduction, compared with normal Linux and VM reboots, is 77% and 79% in Kexec and Phase-based reboot, respectively.",ISSRE,rej,OS（Linux）

While many excellent tools for identifying memory leaks exist, they are inappropriate for automated leak detection or isolation as they require developer involvement or slow down execution considerably. In this work we propose a lightweight approach which allows for automated leak detection during the standardized unit or integration tests. The core idea is to compare at the byte-code level the memory allocation behavior of related development versions of the same software. We evaluate our approach by injecting memory leaks into the YARN component of the popular Hadoop framework and comparing the accuracy of detection and isolation in various scenarios.

Since a VMM is fundamental software for running VMs, its performance degradation or crash failure affects all VMs running on top of it. To counteract such software aging, a proactive technique called software rejuvenation has been proposed. A simple example of rejuvenation is to reboot a VMM. However, simply rebooting a VMM is undesirable because that needs rebooting operating systems on all VMs. In this paper, we propose a new technique for fast rejuvenation of VMMs called the warm-VM reboot. The warm-VM reboot enables efficiently rebooting only a VMM by suspending and resuming VMs without saving the memory images to persistent storage. To achieve this, we have developed two mechanisms: on-memory suspend/resume of VMs and quick reload of a VMM. Compared with a normal reboot, the warm-VM reboot reduced the downtime by 74 percent at maximum. It also prevented the performance degradation due to cache misses after the reboot, which was 52 percent in case of a normal reboot. In a cluster environment, the warm-VM reboot achieved higher total throughput than the system using VM migration and a normal reboot.",TDSC,rej,虚拟化系统&集群

This prevent from drawing general conclusions (e.g., about the aging-workload relationship), and from comparing systems from the aging perspective.

To counteract this phenomenon, a preventive approach to fault management, called software rejuvenation has been proposed. In this paper, we propose a framework which provides transparent and predictive software rejuvenation to web services that suffer software aging on virtualized platforms, achieving high levels of availability.

In this policy, time based rejuvenation policy is performed from the system's start or restart, during which prediction based policy is also employed.

Aging-related failures are very difficult to observe, because the accumulation of aging effects usually requires a long-term execution. Thus, collecting a statistically significant sample of times to aging-related failures so as to estimate the system's lifetime distribution is a very hard task. This is an important problem that prevents many experimental and analytical studies, mainly those focused on modeling of software aging aspects, of using representative parameter values. In this paper we propose and evaluate the use of quantitative accelerated life tests (QALT) to reduce the time to obtain the lifetime distribution of systems that fail due to software aging. Since QALT was developed for hardware failures, in this paper, we adapt it to software aging experiments. We test the proposed approach experimentally, estimating the lifetime distribution of a real web server system. The accuracy of the estimated distribution is evaluated by comparing its reliability estimates with a sample of failure times observed from the real system under test. The mean time to failure calculated from the real sample falls inside the 90% confidence interval constructed from the estimated lifetime distribution, demonstrating the high accuracy of the estimated model. The proposed approach reduces the time required to obtain the failure times by a factor of seven, for the real system investigated.",ISSRE,testing,web服务器（Apache）

We evaluate several state-of-the-art classification methods for their accuracy and computational efficiency in this scenario. The studies are performed on a data set generated by a TPC-W benchmark instrumented with a memory leak injector.

Moreover the concept of a failed rejuvenation is introduced to model the fact that rejuvenation due to some circumstances cannot be accomplished. As the load of such a system varies from hour to hour but reveals a cyclic behavior from day to day, different rejuvenation policies for each period of the day are proposed using a cyclic non-homogeneous Markov (CNHM) model. As a measure of performance, the steady-state expected downtime cost is considered.

Three rejuvenation policies, namely standard rejuvenation, delayed rejuvenation and mixed rejuvenation, are designed to improve the cluster’s performability under varying workload. Analytic models are built to evaluate these three policies. Since deterministic transitions are used in this paper and analytical models based on homogeneous continuous-time Markov chains (CTMC) do not allow non-exponential distributions, we utilize deterministic and stochastic Petri nets (DSPN), in which the underlying stochastic process is a Markov regenerative process (MRGP), to capture both exponential and deterministic distributions. System performability measures under these three rejuvenation policies are derived based on the DSPN models. We show that the mixed rejuvenation policy achieves the maximum performability among the three policies, which results in 12% improvement on the system throughput in the example shown in this paper. The delayed rejuvenation is better than the standard rejuvenation with respect to the optimal job blocking probability and system throughput. For longer rejuvenation-triggering intervals, the standard rejuvenation yields a better result than delayed rejuvenation, while for shorter rejuvenation-triggering intervals the delayed rejuvenation policy outperforms standard rejuvenation policy.",PEVA,Model-based,集群

Recently, the phenomenon of “software aging”, which was caused by aging-related faults, is observed in many software systems.

A stochastic time series decomposition algorithm based on robust locally weighted regression (Loess) is presented to separate the exhaustion of system resource from the resource usage, from which aging trend is estimated. Then the model of software aging and software failure process is constructed. Experiments on a practical server system verify the effectiveness of the algorithm presented in this paper, and the two-stage failure process is also confirmed for the first time in the history of research on software aging. The conclusions drawn from this paper will greatly benefit the application of software rejuvenation technique, that is, it makes it easy to determine when to perform software rejuvenation, which is a key issue in implementation of software rejuvenation.

This type of performance degradation - caused mostly by resource depletion - is common, as we illustrate in a study of the popular Axis Soap server 1.3. In particular, we propose deterministic models for approximating the leading indicators of aging and an automated procedure for statistical testing of their correctness. We further demonstrate how to use these models for finding optimal rejuvenation schedules under utility functions. Our focus is on the important case that the utility function is the average of a performance metric (such as maximum service rate). We also consider optional SLA constraints under which the performance should never drop below a specified level. Our approach is verified by a study of the aging processes in the Axis Soap 1.3 server.

Causes of this phenomenon, which has been referred to as “software aging”, are the accumulation of internal error conditions, and the depletion of operating system resources. A proactive technique called “software rejuvenation” has been proposed as a way to counteract software aging. It involves occasionally terminating the software application, cleaning its internal state and/or its environment, and then restarting it. Due to the costs incurred by software rejuvenation, an important question is when to schedule this action. While periodic rejuvenation at constant time intervals is straightforward to implement, it may not yield the best results. The rate at which software ages is usually not constant, but it depends on the time-varying system workload. Software rejuvenation should therefore be planned & initiated in the face of the actual system behavior. This requires the measurement, analysis, and prediction of system resource usage. In this paper, we study the development of resource usage in a web server while subjecting it to an artificial workload. We first collect data on several system resource usage & activity parameters. Non-parametric statistical methods are then applied toward detecting & estimating trends in the data sets. Finally, we fit time series models to the data collected. Unlike the models used previously in the research on software aging, these time series models allow for seasonal patterns, and we show how the exploitation of the seasonal variation can help in adequately predicting the future resource usage. Based on the models employed here, proactive management techniques like software rejuvenation triggered by actual measurements can be built.",TR,Measurement-based（时间序列）,web服务器、操作系统（Linux、Apache）

This paper presents the results of an experimental research work, which evaluated the software aging effects on a web server as well as the performance of a rejuvenation agent. Its main contribution is the identification and analytical validation of the factors that contribute for the web server aging. We adopted the design of experiment technique (DOE) to characterize the aging phenomenon. The results showed evidence that the 'page type' and 'page size' factors were responsible for over 99% of memory size variation in httpd processes. A 'rejuvenation agent' was implemented and integrated into the server environment to mitigate the aging effects. As a result, the size of the httpd processes could be kept under control and a higher availability and performance of the web server could be provided, as compared to the scenario without rejuvenation.",COMPSAC,度量; Measurement-based（阈值）; rej,web服务器（Apache）

At the low level of the model hierarchy is a degradation model in which we use a nonhomogeneous Markov chain to establish an explicit connection between resource leaks, and the failure rate. With the degradation model, we prove that the failure rate is asymptotically constant in the absence of resource leaks, and it is increasing as leaks occur & accumulate, which confirms the resource leaks as an aging source. The proactive fault management (PFM) is modeled at the higher level as a semi-Markov process. The PFM model takes as input the degradation analysis from the low-level model, and allows us to determine optimal rejuvenation schedules with respect to various system measures.",TR,Hybrid,服务器

This phenomenon, which may eventually lead to system performance degradation and/or crash/hang failure, is the result of exhaustion of operating system resources, data corruption, and numerical error accumulation. To counteract software aging, a technique called software rejuvenation has been proposed, which essentially involves occasionally terminating an application or a system, cleaning its internal state and/or its environment, and restarting it. Since rejuvenation incurs an overhead, an important research issue is to determine optimal times to initiate this action. In this paper, we first describe how to include faults attributed to software aging in the framework of Gray's software fault classification (deterministic and transient), and study the treatment and recovery strategies for each of the fault classes. We then construct a semi-Markov reward model based on workload and resource usage data collected from the UNIX operating system. We identify different workload states using statistical cluster analysis, estimate transition probabilities, and sojourn time distributions from the data. Corresponding to each resource, a reward function is then defined for the model based on the rate of resource depletion in each state. The model is then solved to obtain estimated times to exhaustion for each resource. The result from the semi-Markov reward model are then fed into a higher-level availability model that accounts for failure followed by reactive recovery, as well as proactive recovery. This comprehensive model is then used to derive optimal rejuvenation schedules that maximize availability or minimize downtime cost.",TDSC,Hybrid,OS（UNIX）

The framework is constructed based on three building blocks, namely, a rejuvenation algorithm, a set of performability metrics, and a performability model.

Practically, it is difficult to make a clear-cut definition for repair actions and maintenance actions. They are more distinguishable in hardware systems than in software systems. In the latter, most available system actions can be implemented for both purposes. For example, garbage collection in general can be done on-the-fly as a repair action when a big delay is inflicted on running users. If it is done on a periodic basis as a mechanism to prevent this delay, it belongs to maintenance actions. System capacity (maximum speed) restoration (Avizienis, 1985) also belongs to both types.”</span> <span class=""citation"" data-citation=""%7B%22citationItems%22%3A%5B%7B%22uris%22%3A%5B%22http%3A%2F%2Fzotero.org%2Fgroups%2F4571939%2Fitems%2FKSQ5LJ3Z%22%5D%2C%22locator%22%3A%2259%22%7D%5D%2C%22properties%22%3A%7B%7D%7D"">(<span class=""citation-item"">Ghoneim, 2003, p. 59</span>)</span></p> </div>",验证方法：数值分析; 重生层级：非特定的; 系统类型：非特定的; 老化影响：性能降级; 分析方式：度量&Model-based; 模型：排队模型; 期刊：SQJ; 指标：恶化响应度量DRM（软件随时间和负载的恶化速度）；衰减恢复速度值、可恢复性指数、增加操作间隔偏移,,,SQJ,度量; Model-based,非特定的

To counteract this phenomenon, a proactive technique called ""software rejuvenation"" has been proposed. This essentially involves stopping the running software, cleaning its internal state and then restarting it. Software rejuvenation, being preventive in nature, begs the question as to when to schedule it. Periodic rejuvenation, while straightforward to implement, may not yield the best results. A better approach is based on actual measurement of system resource usage and activity that detects and estimates resource exhaustion times. Estimating the resource exhaustion times makes it possible for software rejuvenation to be initiated or better planned so that the system availability is maximized in the face of time-varying workload and system behavior. We propose a methodology based on time series analysis to detect and estimate resource exhaustion times due to software aging in a Web server while subjecting it to an artificial workload. We first collect and log data on several system resource usage and activity parameters on a Web server. Time-series ARMA models are then constructed from the data to detect aging and estimate resource exhaustion times. The results are then compared with previous measurement-based models and found to be more efficient and computationally less intensive. These models can be used to develop proactive management techniques like software rejuvenation which are triggered by actual measurements.",ESE,Measurement-based（时间序列）,web服务器（Apache）

The current investigation explores the feasibility of applying an advanced pattern recognition method that is embodied in a commercially available equipment condition monitoring system (SmartSignal eCM/spl trade/) for proactive annunciation of software-aging faults.

Preventive maintenance of operational software systems is used specifically to counteract this phenomenon. However preventive maintenance incurs an overhead in terms of downtime and cost and this must be traded off with the cost of failures to obtain maximum benefits. We present an analytical model of a software system employing inspection-based preventive maintenance, through a Markov Regenerative Process (MRGP) with a subordinated semi-Markov reward process. Furthermore, we consider preemptive-resume type transitions. The model is solved for steady state as well as transient conditions and expressions for expected downtime and expected cost are derived. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the applicability of the models. With the help of these models, optimal strategies for preventive maintenance techniques such as ""software rejuvenation"" could be formulated.",RELDIS,Model-based,软件系统

Based on this methodology, we present two different strategies that allow to decide whether and when to rejuvenate, and we exploit the theory of renewal processes with reward to estimate the steady-state unavailability of the software system, which is used to define an optimality criterion that allows us to evaluate the proper rejuvenation intervals.

Exhaustion of system resources, data corruption, and numerical error accumulation are the primary symptoms of this degradation, which may eventually lead to performance degradation of the software, crash/hang failure, or other undesirable effects. “Software rejuvenation” is a proactive technique intended to reduce the probability of future unplanned outages due to aging. The basic idea is to pause or halt the running software, refresh its internal state, and resume or restart it. Software rejuvenation can be performed by relying on a variety of indicators of aging, or on the time elapsed since the last rejuvenation. In response to the strong desire of customers to be provided with advance notice of unplanned outages, our group has developed techniques that dete ct the occurrence of software aging due to resource exhaustion, estimate the time remaining until the exhaustion reaches a critical level, and automatically perform proactive software rejuvenation of an application, process group, or entire operating system, depending on the pervasiveness of the resource exhaustion and our ability to pinpoint the source. This technology has been incorporated into the IBM Director for xSeries servers. To quantitatively evaluate the impact of different rejuvenation policies on the availability of cluster systems, we have developed analytical models based on stochastic reward nets (SRNs). For time-based rejuvenation policies, we determined the optimal rejuvenation interval based on system availability and cost. We also analyzed a rejuvenation policy based on prediction, and showed that it can further increase system availability and reduce downtime cost. These models are very general and can capture a multitude of cluster system characteristics, failure behavior, and performabil ity measures, which we are just beginning to explore.",IBM J RES DEV,Model-based,cluster system

First, we present the design and implementation of an SNMP based, distributed monitoring tool used to collect operating system resource usage and system activity data at regular intervals, from networked UNIX workstations. Statistical trend detection techniques are applied to this data to detect/validate the existence of aging. For quantifying the effect of aging in operating system resources, we propose a metric: ""estimated time to exhaustion"", which is calculated using well known slope estimation techniques. Although the distributed data collection tool is specific to UNIX, the statistical techniques can be used for detection and estimation of aging in other software as well.",ISSRE,度量; Measurement-based（统计）,OS（UNIX）

The necessity to do preventive maintenance, not only in general purpose software systems of mass use, but also in safety-critical and highly available systems, clearly indicates the need to follow an analysis based approach to determine the optimal times to perform preventive maintenance. In this paper, we present an analytical model of a software system which serves transactions. Due to aging, not only the service rate of the software decreases with time, but also the software itself experiences crash/hang failures which result in its unavailability. Two policies for preventive maintenance are modeled and expressions for resulting steady state availability, probability that an arriving transaction is lost and an upper bound on the expected response time of a transition are derived. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the applicability of the models.",TC,Model-based,client-server type system

In a client-server type of application where the server is intended to ran perpetually for providing a service to its clients, rejuvenating the server process periodically during the most idle time of the server increases the availability of that service. In a long-running computation-intensive application, rejuvenating the application periodically and restarting it at a previous checkpoint increases the likelihood of successfully completing the application execution. We present a model for analyzing software rejuvenation in such continuously-running applications and express downtime and costs due to downtime during rejuvenation in terms of the parameters in that model. Threshold conditions for rejuvenation to be beneficial are also derived. We implemented a reusable module to perform software rejuvenation. That module can be embedded in any existing application on a UNIX platform with minimal effort. Experiences with software rejuvenation in a billing data collection subsystem of a telecommunications operations system and other continuously-running systems and scientific applications in AT&T are described.<>",FTCS,Model-based,client-server type system

This ""renewal"" of software prevents (or at least postpones) the crash failure. As the time lost (or the cost incurred) due to the software failure is typically more than the time lost (or the cost incurred) due to rejuvenation, the technique reduces the expected unavailability of the software. We present a quantitative analysis of software rejuvenation. The behavior of the system is represented through a Markov Regenerative Stochastic Petri Net (MRSPN) model which is solved both for steady state as well as transient conditions. We provide a closed-form analytical solution for the steady state expected down time (and the expected cost incurred) due to system unavailability.
